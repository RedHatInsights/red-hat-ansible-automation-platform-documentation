= Automation Platform Operator 2.2

The Ansible Automation Platform Operator provides cloud-native, push-button deployment of new Ansible Automation Platform instances in your OpenShift environment.

.Deprecated functionality

* The `image_pull_secret` (string) variable has been deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future release. You should now use the `image_pull_secrets` (array) variable on the spec when creating an Automation Hub or Automation Controller custom resource. This new variable allows you to specify multiple pull secrets as an array, for example:
-----
spec:
  image_pull_secrets:
    - redhat-operators-pull-secret
    - my-other-pull-secret
-----

.Enhancements

* Fixed an issue where the pulp resource manager was not removed on upgrade from Automation Platform Operator 2.1 to Automation Platform Operator 2.2.
