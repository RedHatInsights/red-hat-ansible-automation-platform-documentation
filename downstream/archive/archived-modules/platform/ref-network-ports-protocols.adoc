= Network ports and protocols

[role="_abstract"]

{PlatformName} (AAP) uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the {PlatformName} server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not being blocked by the server firewall.

The following tables show the default {PlatformName} destination ports required for each application.

[NOTE]
The following default destination ports and installer inventory listed are configurable. If you choose to configure them to suit your environment, you might experience a change in behavior.
