= Gathering system-level dependencies

The `bindep` format provides a way of specifying cross-platform requirements. A minimum expectation is that the collection(s) specify necessary requirements for `[platform:rpm]`.

Below is an example of content from a valid `bindep.txt` file:

.A `bindep.txt` file
====
----
python38-devel [platform:rpm compile]
subversion [platform:rpm]
git-lfs [platform:rpm]
----
====

Entries from multiple collections will be combined into a single file. This will be processed by `bindep` and then passed to `dnf`. Only requirements with no profiles or no runtime requirements will be installed to the image.
