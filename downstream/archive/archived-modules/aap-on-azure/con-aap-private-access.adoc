= Private deployment

A private deployment of {PlatformNameShort} resides in an isolated Azure VNet with no access from external sources: traffic to and from the public internet and other Azure VNets and subnets is blocked.

To access the URLs for the {PlatformNameShort} user interfaces, you must configure network peering.

Once peering and routing are configured, users can access {PlatformNameShort} through a VM on a connected Azure subnet, or directly if your organization has transit routing set up between Azure and your local network.


[NOTE]
====
No two Azure networking configurations are the same.
To allow user access to your {PlatformNameShort} URLs, your organization will need to work with your Azure administrators to connect the private access deployment.

The following diagram outlines the application resources and architecture that are deployed into the managed application resource group on a private deployment of {AAPonAzureNameShort} into your Azure subscription.
The IP ranges change based on the networking address range you set on deployment.
