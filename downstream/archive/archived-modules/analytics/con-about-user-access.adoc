= About user access

User access on the {PlatformName} is based on managing roles to groups, rather than assigning roles to individual users. You can assign roles to a group when you create a group. You can then assign users to these groups, granting each user the roles assigned to their group.

Groups created in {InsightsShort} can range from system administrators responsible for configuring user access to users who can view and share automation data.
