[role="_abstract"]
You can use direct peering to directly connect virtual networks.
When two networks are peered, Azure updates routes between them so that traffic automatically flows between them.

The direct peering method is easier to configure than the hub-and-spoke model.
However, the number of direct network peerings is limited.
Direct peering becomes difficult to manage as the number of virtual networks grows, because each new network requires peering to all other networks.
