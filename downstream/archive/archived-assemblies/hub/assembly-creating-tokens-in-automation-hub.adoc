= Creating the Red Hat Automation Hub API token

Before you can interact with Automation Hub by uploading or downloading collections, you need to create an API token. The Automation Hub API token authenticates your `ansible-galaxy` client to the Red Hat Automation Hub server.

To create your API Token:

include::modules/automation-hub/proc-create-api-token.adoc[leveloffset=+1]]


The API token is now available to include in the `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` file or when uploading collections using the `ansible-galaxy` command line tool.
