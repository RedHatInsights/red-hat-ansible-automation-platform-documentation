= Configuring Red Hat Automation Hub as the primary source of Ansible content

The Ansible Galaxy client, `ansible-galaxy`, manages roles and collections from the command line.

To ensure that `ansible-galaxy` uses certified, supported Ansible collections whenever possible, you should update the `ansible.cfg` configuration file to use Red Hat Automation Hub as the primary source of Ansible collections.

Optionally, you can configure Ansible Galaxy as a secondary source of content.
