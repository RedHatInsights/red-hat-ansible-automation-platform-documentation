= Ansible Tower 3.8.4

.Bux fixes

* Running inventories of ~60k hosts no longer takes a very long time for events to show up

* Removed `artifact_data` from data sent to analytics as part of `playbook_on_stats`, since `artifact_data` can contain PII or sensitive data

* Updated Django version to 2.2.20

* Regular users are no longer experiencing longer load times than a superuser when clicking to edit a job template

* Updated password validation support to allow modifying password complexity requirements using some Django configurations

* Fixed AWS inventory tags filtering to support the `OR` condition

* Fixed a python-urllib3 vulnerability (CVE-2021-33503)
