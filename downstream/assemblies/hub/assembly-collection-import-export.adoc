[role="_abstract"]
Ansible {HubName} stores collections within repositories. These collections are versioned by the curator, therefore, many versions of the same collection can exist in the same or different repositories at the same time.

Collections are stored as tar files that can be imported and exported. This ensures the collection you are importing to a new repository is the same one that was originally created and exported.
