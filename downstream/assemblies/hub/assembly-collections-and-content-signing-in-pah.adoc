= Collections and content signing in {PrivateHubName}

As an automation administrator for your organization, you can configure {PrivateHubName} for signing and publishing Ansible content collections from different groups within your organization.

For additional security, automation creators can configure Ansible-Galaxy CLI to verify these collections to ensure that they have not been changed after they were uploaded to {HubName}.
