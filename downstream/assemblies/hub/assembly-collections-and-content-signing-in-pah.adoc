= Collections and content signing in {PrivateHubName}

As an automation administrator for your organization, you can configure private automation hub for signing and publishing Ansible content collections from different groups within your organization.

For additional security, automation creators can configure Ansible-Galaxy CLI to verify these collections to ensure they have not been changed after they were uploaded to automation hub.
