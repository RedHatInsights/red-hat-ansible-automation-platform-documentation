= Enabling view-only access for your private automation hub

By enabling view-only access, you can grant access for users to view collections or namespaces on your private automation hub without the need for them to log in. View-only access allows you to share content with unauthorized users while restricting their ability to download and view source code or otherwise change anything on your private automation hub.
