= Configuring {HubNameMain} remote repositories to synchronize content

You can configure your {PrivateHubName} to synchronize with {CertifiedName} hosted on `{Console}` or to your choice of collections in {Galaxy}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of the 2.4 release you can still synchronize content, but synclists are deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.

From Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 a private automation hub administrator can go to the rh-certified remote and upload a manually-created requirements file. 

Remotes are configurations that allow you to synchronize content to your custom repositories from an external collection source.
