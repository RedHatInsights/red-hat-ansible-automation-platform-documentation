== Configuring validated or certified collections with the installer

When you download and run the bundle installer, certified and validated collections are automatically uploaded. 
Certified colections are uploaded into the `rh-certified` repository, while validated collections are uploaded into the `validated` repository. 

This behavior can be configured with two variables:

[cols="20%,50%",options="header"]
|====
| Name | Description 
| `automationhub_seed_collections` | A boolean that defines whether or not preloading is enabled.
| `automationhub_collection_seed_repository` | If `automationhub_seed_collections` is set to `true`, this variable enables you to specify the type of content to upload. 
Possible values are certified or validated. 
If missing both content sets will be uploaded.
