[id="assembly-validated-content"]
= {Valid}

{PlatformName} includes {Valid}, which complements existing {CertifiedCon}.

{Valid} provides an expert-led path for performing operational tasks on a variety of platforms including both Red Hat and our trusted partners.

== Configuring validated collections with the installer

When you download and run the bundle installer, certified and validated collections are automatically uploaded.
Certified collections are uploaded into the `rh-certified` repository.
Validated collections are uploaded into the `validated` repository.

You can change to default configuration by using two variables:

[cols="20%,50%",options="header"]
|====
| Name | Description
| `automationhub_seed_collections` | A boolean that defines whether or not preloading is enabled.
| `automationhub_collection_seed_repository` | If `automationhub_seed_collections` is set to `true`, this variable enables you to specify the type of content to upload.
Possible values are `certified` or `validated`.
If missing both content sets will be uploaded.
|====

== Installing validated content using the tarball

If you are not using the bundle installer, a standalone tarball, `ansible-validated-content-bundle-1.tar.gz` can be used instead.
The standalone tarball can also be used later to update validated contents later in any environment, when a newer tarball becomes available, and without having to re-run the bundle installer.

To obtain the tarball, navigate to the link:{PlatformDownloadUrl}[{PlatformName} download] page and select *Ansible Validated Content*.

You require the following variables to run the playbook. 

[cols="20%,50%",options="header"]
|====
| Name | Description
| *`automationhub_admin_password`* | Your administration password.
| *`automationhub_api_token`* | The API token generated for your {HubName}.
| *`automationhub_main_url`* | For example, `\https://automationhub.example.com`
| *`automationhub_require_content_approval`* | Boolean (`true` or `false`)

This must match the value used during {HubName} deployment.

This variable is set to `true` by the installer.
|====

[NOTE]
====
Use either `automationhub_admin_password` or `automationhub_api_token`, not both.
====

Upload the content and define the variables (this example uses `automationhub_api_token`):

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
ansible-playbook collection_seed.yml
-e automationhub_api_token=<api_token>
-e automationhub_main_url=https://automationhub.example.com
-e automationhub_require_content_approval=true
----

For more information on running ansible playbooks, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html[ansible-playbook].

When complete, the collections are visible in the validated collection section of {PrivateHubName}.
