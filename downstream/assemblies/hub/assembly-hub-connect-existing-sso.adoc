= Connecting {HubName} to an existing {RHSSO} environment

To connect {HubName} to an existing {RHSSO} installation, configure variables in the inventory file.

You must configure a different set of variables for connecting to an {RHSSO} installation managed by {PlatformNameShort} than for connecting to an external {RHSSO} installation.

Run the installer setup script after you have configured the appropriate inventory variables.
