= Adding a User Storage Provider (LDAP/Kerberos) to {AAPCentralAuth}

{AAPCentralAuth} comes with a built-in LDAP/AD provider. You can add your LDAP provider to {CentralAuth} to be able to import user attributes from your LDAP database.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in as an SSO admin user.

.Procedure
. Log in to {AAPCentralAuth} as an SSO admin user.
. From the navigation bar, select menu:Configure section[User Federation].

[NOTE]
====
When using an LDAP User Federation in {RHSSOshort}, a group mapper must be added to the client configuration, ansible-automation-platform, to expose the identity provider (IDP) groups to the SAML authentication. Refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.5/html-single/server_administration_guide/index#protocol-mappers[OIDC Token and SAML Assertion Mappings] for more information on SAML assertion mappers.
