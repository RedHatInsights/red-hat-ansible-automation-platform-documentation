== Managing group permissions with {AAPCentralAuth}

You can manage user access on the {PlatformNameShort} by grouping specific permissions into roles, and then assigning those roles to groups. As you log in to the {PlatformNameShort} for the first time, *Users*, *Groups*, and *Roles* appear in the user access page in {HubName}, then you can assign user access and roles to each group.

{HubNameStart} includes a set of managed roles that are compatible with use cases you may encounter. You can create your own set of managed roles or use the predefined roles located in the *Roles* section of the *User Access* page.
