= Assigning {HubName} administrator permissions

Hub administrative users will need to be assigned the role of _hubadmin_ in order to manage user permissions and groups. You can assign the role of _hubadmin_ to a user through the {AAPCentralAuth} client.

.Prerequisites
* A user storage provider (e.g., LDAP) has been added to your {CentralAuth}

.Procedure
. Navigate to the `ansible-automation-platform` realm on your SSO client.
. From the navigation bar, select menu:Manage[Users].
. Select a user from the list by clicking their ID.
. Click the *Role Mappings* tab.
. Using the dropdown menu under _Client Roles_, select *automation-hub*.
. Click *hubadmin* from the _Available Roles_ field, then click btn:[Add selected >].

The user is now a _hubadmin_. Repeat steps 3-6 to assign any additional users the _hubadmin_ role.
