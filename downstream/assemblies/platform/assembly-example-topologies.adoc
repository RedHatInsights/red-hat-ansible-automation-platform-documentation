:context: standalone-controller-non-inst-database

[role="_abstract"]
The automation mesh topologies in this setion are intended to provide examples you can use to design a mesh deployment in your environment. Examples range from a single, hydrid node deployment to a complex pattern that deploys numerous {ControllerName}s, employing several execution and hop nodes.

== Prerequisites
* You reviewed conceptual information on node types and relationsips
