= {ControllerNameStart} configuration

You can configure some {ControllerName} options using the *Settings* menu of the User Interface.

//Each tab contains fields with a *Reset* option, enabling you to revert any value entered back to the default value.
//*Reset All* enables you to revert all the values to their factory default values.

//*Save* applies the changes you make, but it does not exit the edit dialog.
To return to the *Settings* page, from the navigation panel select {MenuAEAdminSettings} or use the breadcrumbs at the top of the current view.
