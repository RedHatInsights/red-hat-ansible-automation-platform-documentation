= Installing {ControllerName} with a database on the same node

:context: standalone-controller-non-inst-database

[role="_abstract"]
You can use these instructions to install a standalone instance of {ControllerName} with a database on the same node, or a non-installer managed database. 
This scenario includes installation of {ControllerName}, including the web frontend, REST API backend, and database on a single machine. 
It installs PostgreSQL, and configures the {ControllerName} to use that as its database. 
This is considered the standard {ControllerName} installation scenario.

* You are installing on a machine that meets base system requirements.
* You have updated all of the packages to the recent version of your RHEL nodes.

WARNING: You may experience errors if you do not fully upgrade your RHEL nodes prior to your {PlatformNameShort} installation.

* You have created a Red Hat Registry Service Account, following the instructions in the https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#creating-registry-service-accounts-6[Creating Registry Service Accounts guide].
