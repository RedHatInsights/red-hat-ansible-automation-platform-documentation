= Installing {ControllerName} with a database on the same node

:context: standalone-controller-non-inst-database

[role="_abstract"]
You can use these instructions to install a standalone instance of {ControllerName} with a database on the same node, or a non-installer managed database. This scenario includes installation of {ControllerName}, including the web frontend, REST API backend, and database on a single machine. It installs PostgreSQL, and configures the {ControllerName} to use that as its database. This is considered the standard {ControllerName} installation scenario.


== Prerequisites

* You chose and obtained a platform installer
* You are installing on a machine that meets base system requirements.
* You have created a Red Hat Registry Service Account, following the instructions in the https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#creating-registry-service-accounts-6[Creating Registry Service Accounts guide].
