= Upgrading to {PlatformName} {PlatformVers}

[role="_abstract"]

Upgrade to {PlatformName} {PlatformVers} by setting up your inventory and running the installation script.
Ansible then upgrades your deployment to {PlatformVers}.
If you plan to upgrade from {PlatformNameShort} 2.0 or earlier, you first need to migrate Ansible content for compatibility with {PlatformVers}.
