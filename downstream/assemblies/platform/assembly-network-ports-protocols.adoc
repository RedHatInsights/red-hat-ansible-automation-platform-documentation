= Network ports and protocols

[role="_abstract"]

{PlatformName} (AAP) uses a number of ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connection to the {PlatformName} server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not being blocked by the server firewall.

The following architectural diagram is an example of a fully deployed {PlatformNameShort} with all possible components.

The following tables provide the default {PlatformName} destination ports required for each application.

[NOTE]
The default destination ports and installer inventory listed below are configurable. If you choose to configure them to suit your environment, you may experience a change in behavior.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Image manifests and filesystem blobs are served directly from `registry.redhat.io`.
However, from 1 May 2023, filesystem blobs are served from `quay.io` instead.
To avoid problems pulling container images, you must enable outbound connections to the listed `quay.io` hostnames.

This change should be made to any firewall configuration that specifically enables outbound connections to `registry.redhat.io`.

Use the hostnames instead of IP addresses when configuring firewall rules.

After making this change, you can continue to pull images from `registry.redhat.io`.
You do not require a `quay.io` login, or need to interact with the `quay.io` registry directly in any way to continue pulling Red Hat container images.
