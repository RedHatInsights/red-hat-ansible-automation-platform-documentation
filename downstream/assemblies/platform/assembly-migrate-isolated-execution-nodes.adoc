= Upgrading isolated nodes to execution nodes

[role="_abstract"]
Upgrading from version 1.x to the latest version of the {PlatformName} requires platform administrations to migrate data from isolated legacy nodes to execution nodes. This migration is necessary to deploy the automation mesh.

This guide explains how to perform a side-by-side migration. This ensures that the data on your original automation environment remains untouched during the migration process.

The migration process involves the following steps:

. Verify upgrade configurations.
. Backup original instance.
. Deploy new instance for a side-by-side upgrade.
. Recreate instance groups in the new instance using ansible controller.
. Restore original backup to new instance.
. Set up execution nodes and upgrade instance to {PlatformName} {PlatformVers}.
. Configure upgraded controller instance.

This backup will be necessary later to migrate content from your old instance to the new one.

You will upgrade this new instance to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers} so that you keep all your previous data without overwriting your original instance.
