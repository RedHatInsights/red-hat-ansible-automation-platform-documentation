= Installing {PlatformName} with a database on the {ControllerName} node or non-installer managed database

:context: platform-non-inst-database

[role="_abstract"]
You can use these instructions to install {PlatformName} (both {ControllerName} and {HubName}) with a database on the {ControllerName} node, or a non-installer managed database.


== Prerequisites

* You chose and obtained a platform installer from the link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480/ver=2.2/rhel---9/2.2/x86_64/product-software[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Product Software].
* You are installing on a machine that meets base system requirements.
* You have created a Red Hat Registry Service Account, following the instructions in the https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#creating-registry-service-accounts-6[Creating Registry Service Accounts guide].
* A container registry service is required to install {PlatformNameShort}. 
Access to a container registry enables you to load automation execution environments onto the {PlatformNameShort}, giving you a consistent and containerized environment for executing Ansible playbooks and roles. 
By default, the {PlatformNameShort} uses `registry.redhat.io`, which requires a Red Hat registry service account. 
See the https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#creating-registry-service-accounts-6[Creating Registry Service Accounts] guide to create a registry service account.
