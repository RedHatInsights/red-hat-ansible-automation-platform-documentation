= Installing and configuring {HubName} on {OCP} web console

:context: installing-hub-operator

[role="_abstract"]
You can use these instructions to install the {HubName} operator on {OCP}, specify custom resources, and deploy {PlatformNameShort} with an external database.

{HubNameStart} configuration should be done through the custom resource specification and not directly to the Hub deployments because the changes will not persist. Hub settings should always be set as lowercase on the Hub custom resource specification.

[NOTE]
====
When an instance of {HubName} is removed, the PVCs are not automatically deleted. This can cause issues during migration if the new deployment has the same name as the previous one. Therefore, it is recommended that you manually remove old PVCs before deploying a new {HubName} instance in the same namespace. See xref:proc-find-delete-PVCs_{context}[Finding and deleting PVCs] for more information.
