= Upgrading from {PlatformName} 1.2 on-prem to {PlatformName} 2.x operator on {OCP}


:context: assembly_upgrading-from-aap-on-prem-to-aap-operator-on-ocp

[role="_abstract"]

As a platform administrator who wants to upgrade from {PlatformName} 1.2 on prem or on virtual machines, you must upgrade to the {PlatformName} 2.x operator on {OCP} {OCPLatest} in order to easily deploy and manage {PlatformNameShort} components on {OCPShort} for efficient automation of application development and IT management for your organization.

To perform this task successfully, you must:

* Set up secret key files.
* Create a database secret key.
* Expose the host as an external IP.
* Install {PlatformName} operator from {OperatorHub} and use the your previous database key when deploying a new {ControllerName}.
