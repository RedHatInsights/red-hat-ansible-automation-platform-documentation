= Control plane adjustments

The control plane refers to the {ControllerName} pods which contain the web and task containers that, among other things, provide the user interface and handle the scheduling and launching of jobs.  
On the {ControllerName} custom resource, the number of _replicas_ determines the number of {ControllerName} pods in the {ControllerName} deployment.
