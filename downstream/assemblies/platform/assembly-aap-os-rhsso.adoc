= {RHSSO} integration with {ControllerName}

[role="_abstract"]

{RHSSO} ({RHSSOshort}) is based on the Keycloak project and enables you to secure {PlatformNameShort} by providing single sign-on (SSO) capabilities based on popular standards such as SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

{PlatformName} supports SAML authentication by default. Beginning with {PlatformNameShort} 2.x, you can enhance security by delegating authentication to Red Hat Single Sign-on.

.Prerequisites
- A running instance of {RHSSOshort}
- A running installation of automation controller from {PlatformNameShort} 2.x
- Administrator rights to the two systems
- A valid host name
