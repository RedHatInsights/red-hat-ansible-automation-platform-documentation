If upgrading from older versions of {ControllerName} to 4.0 or later, the controller has the ability to detect previous versions of virtual environments associated with Organizations, Inventory, and Job Templates; and inform you that you will need to migrate to the new {ExecEnvName} model. A brand new installation of {ControllerName} creates two virtualenvs during installation--one is used to run the controller itself, while the other is used to run Ansible. Like legacy virtual environments, {ExecEnvName} allow the controller to run in a stable environment, while allowing you to add or update modules to your {ExecEnvName} as necessary to run your playbooks.

.Migrate legacy venvs to {ExecEnvName}

You can have the exact same setup in an {ExecEnvNameSing} that you had in a prior custom virtual environment by migrating them to the new {ExecEnvNameSing}. Use the awx-manage commands in this section to:

* list of all the current custom virtual environments and their paths (`list_custom_venvs`)
* view the resources that rely a particular custom virtual environment (`custom_venv_associations`)
* export a particular custom virtual environment to a format that can be used to migrate to an {ExecEnvNameSing} (`export_custom_venv`)

The below workflow describes how to migrate from legacy venvs to {ExecEnvName} using the `awx-manage` command.
