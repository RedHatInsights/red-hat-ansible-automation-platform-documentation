= Encrypting plaintext passwords in {ControllerName} configuration files

:context: encrypt-password

Passwords stored in {ControllerName} configuration files are stored in plain text. 
A user with access to the `/etc/tower/conf.d/` directory can view the passwords used to access the database.
Access to the directories is controlled with permissions, so they are protected, but some security findings deem this protection to be inadequate.
The solution is to encrypt the passwords individually.
