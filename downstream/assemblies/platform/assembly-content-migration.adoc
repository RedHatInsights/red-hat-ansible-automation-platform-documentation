If you are migrating from an `ansible-core` version to `ansible-core` 2.13, consider reviewing link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.13/porting_guides/core_porting_guides.html[Ansible core Porting Guides] to familiarize yourself with changes and updates between each version. When reviewing the Ansible core porting guides, ensure that you select the latest version of `ansible-core` or `devel`, which is located at the top left column of the guide.
