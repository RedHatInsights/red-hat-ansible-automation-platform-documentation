= Viewing your reports on {PlatformName}

The reports feature on the {PlatformName} provides users with a visual overview of their automation efforts across different teams using Ansible. Each report is designed to help users monitor the status of their automation environment, be it the frequency of playbook runs or the status of hosts affected by various job templates.

For example, you can use your reports to:

* View the number of hosts affected by a job template
* View the number changes made to hosts by a job template
* View the frequency of a job template run, and the rate of job templates that succeed or fail to run
