= About the Automation Services Catalog Receptor

The Automation Services Catalog Receptor is a plug-in that allows you to connect an instance of Ansible Tower to the Automation Services Catalog service on cloud.redhat.com. The Ansible Role `catalog_receptor_installer` installs the receptor and plug-in components, and registers the Ansible Tower as a source for Automation Services Catalog.

= Automation Services Catalog Receptor installation workflow

The workflow described in the following sections will run both the `install.sh` script to update the environment and the `install_receptor.yml` Ansible playbook to install and configure the Receptor. Configuring the `install_receptor.yml` playbook requires an application token created in your Ansible Tower instance, which is described below.

Completing the Automation Services Catalog Receptor installation workflow in this guide will result in:

* Registering and updating your RHEL environment to include the required versions of Ansible and Python.
* Adding your Ansible Tower as a Source in cloud.redhat.com.
* Adding an end point for the receptor node.
* Adding Automation Services Catalog as a valid application for the Source.
* Triggering an availability check on the source, which will cause an inventory refresh to run.

== Prerequisites

The below tables list the requirements to complete an installation of the Automation Services Catalog Receptor. Ensure you have the required level of access to cloud.redhat.com, Ansible Tower, and a RHEL system that meets the specified requirements.

[NOTE]
====
* For RHEL 8 systems, registering with Red Hat Insights *is not required* to successfully complete the Receptor installation.

* You can run the `install.sh` script to register your system and install required versions of Ansible and Python.

== Retrieving the Automation Services Catalog Receptor installation script and playbook

Use the `install.sh` script and `install_receptor.yml` playbook to install the Receptor plug-in.

You can retrieve the `install.sh` script and `install_receptor.yml` playbook from the following locations:

-----
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkanoor/receptor_catalog_installer_scripts/master/install.sh
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkanoor/receptor_catalog_installer_scripts/master/sample_playbooks/install_receptor.yml
-----

== Setting environmental variables for use with the `install.sh` script

You can use the included `install.sh` to register your system through Red Hat Subscription Manager and install required versions of Ansible, Python, and the Ansible Role.

.Prerequisites
The `install.sh` script requires a valid Red Hat username and password. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_subscription_management/1/[Red Hat Subscription Management] documentation for more information on registering a system.

[NOTE]
====
If your RHEL 8 system is already registered with Red Hat Subscription Management run `subscription-manager clean` before running `install.sh`.
====

.Procedure

. Log in as `root` user.
. Set environmental variables for your username:
+
-----
# export RHN_USER=<yourusername>
-----
+
. Set the environmental variable for your password:
+
-----
# export RHN_PASSWORD=<yourpassword>
-----
+
. (Optional) Set the Red Hat Subscription Management environment URL if you are using a development or testing environment:
+
-----
# export RHSM_URL=your_rhsm_url
-----

You have updated the environmental variables for your username, password and RHSM URL that the `install.sh` will use to register your RHEL system.

== Configuring the `install_receptor.yml` playbook

You can install Receptor by running the `install_receptor.yml` file. Configure the playbook to include the application token you created and the location of the Ansible Tower. Include a display name for the Ansible Tower, so you can locate it as a source on cloud.redhat.com.

.Procedure

. Open the `install_receptor.yml` Ansible playbook in a text editor:
+
-----
$ vim install_receptor.yml
-----
+
. Update the following `vars` parameters:
+
------
vars:
  tower_url: ansible_tower_url
  tower_token: n87FNA7Fajhghag76gkd
  source_display_name: My Ansible Tower
------


== Running the update and installation

You can run the script and playbook once you have finished setting required parameters.

.Procedure

Run the `install.sh` script  and the `install_receptor.yml` playbook:

-----
# ./install.sh sample_playbooks/install_receptor.yml
-----

The `install.sh` will register the system and update Ansible and Python, and the `install_receptor.yml` playbook will install the Receptor and connect your Ansible Tower to cloud.redhat.com. The script will then add the Ansible Tower as a platform source for Automation Services Catalog. Once completed, the script will initiate a refresh of inventory. This may take a few minutes to complete.

== Verifying the Receptor installation

You can verify that the installation and configuration completed successfully by accessing your account on cloud.redhat.com and reviewing sources and inventory.

.Procedure

. Log in to cloud.redhat.com.
. Navigate to menu:image:cog.png[Settings,40,40][Source] and refresh the browser.
.. Your newly added Ansible Tower will appear with the *Name* provided in the `install_receptor.yml` playbook.
. Verify that the *Status* is *Available*.
. Navigate to menu:Automation Services Catalog[Platforms].
. Click on your newly added Ansible Tower.
. Verify that *Templates* and *Inventories* from the Ansible Tower are present.
