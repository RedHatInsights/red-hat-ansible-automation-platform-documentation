= Defining sequential actions in ITSM integration using order processes

Order processes are the primary Automation Services Catalog feature by which you integrate user-ordered products with your ITSM system. Order processes are comprised of products in Automation Services Catalog that are intended to execute job templates that perform actions in your ITSM system. These processes are comprised of *Before order* and *After order* actions. You define your order processes as those products designed to run before and after a product your users order, so that information is passed across the sequence of orders.

.Example sequence

* *before order* - a product that creates a ticket in the ITSM system.
* *product order* -  a web server.
* *after order* - a product that closes the ticket in the ITSM system.

You define the sequence and what products are run by creating an order process that you apply to either your products or at the portfolio level.

For this example workflow, we need to create a order processes and attach them to our *before order*, *product order*, and *after order*.


== Creating an order process

As a catalog administrator, create order processes to allow you to execute your Ansible Tower playbooks before and after a product is ordered.
