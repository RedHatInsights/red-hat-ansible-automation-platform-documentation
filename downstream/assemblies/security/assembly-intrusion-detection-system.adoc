Retains the context of the parent assembly if this assembly is nested within another assembly.

 Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
* file name: assembly-my-user-story.adoc
* ID: [id="assembly-my-user-story_{context}"]
* Title: = My user story

The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken. Include {context} in the ID so the assembly can be reused.

= Automating Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Rules with Ansible

:context: instrusion-detection-system

[role="_abstract"]

You can use Ansible to automate your Intrusion Detection System (IDS). For the purpose of this guide, we use Snort as the IDS. Use Ansible automation hub to consume content collections, such as tasks, roles, and modules to create automated workflows.

[leveloffset=+1] ensures that when a module title is a level 1 heading (= Title), the heading will be interpreted as a level-2 heading (== Title) in the assembly. Use [leveloffset=+2] and [leveloffset=+3] to nest modules in an assembly.
