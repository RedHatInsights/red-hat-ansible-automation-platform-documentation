= Automation controller 4.1

Automation controller replaces Ansible Tower.
Automation controller introduces a distributed, modular architecture with a decoupled control and execution plane.
The name change reflects these enhancements and the overall position within the Ansible Automation Platform suite.

It also introduces new, exciting technologies and an enhanced architecture that enables automation teams to scale and deliver automation rapidly to meet ever-growing business demand.
