= Creating playbooks

[role="_abstract"]
Playbooks contain one or more plays. A basic play contains the following sections:

* Name: a brief description of the overall function of the playbook, which assists in keeping it readable and organized for all users.
* Hosts: identifies the target(s) for Ansible to run against.
* Become statements: this optional statement can be set to `true`/`yes` to enable privilege escalation using a become plugin (such as `sudo`, `su`, `pfexec`, `doas`, `pbrun`, `dzdo`, `ksu`).
* Tasks: this is the list actions that get executed against each host in the play.
