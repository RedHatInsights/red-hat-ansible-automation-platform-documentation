= Setting Up Logging

Use the following procedure to set up logging to any of the aggregator types.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[Logging settings].
. On the *Logging settings* screen, click btn:[Edit].
. Set the following configurable options:

* *Enable External Logging*: Click the toggle button to *ON* if you want to send logs to an external log aggregator.
* *Logging Aggregator*: Enter the hostname or IP address that you want to send logs to.
* *Logging Aggregator Port*: Specify the port for the aggregator if it requires one.
+
[NOTE]
====
When the connection type is HTTPS, you can enter the hostname as a URL with a port number, after which, you are not required to enter the port again. 
However, TCP and UDP connections are determined by the hostname and port number combination, rather than URL. 
Therefore, in the case of a TCP or UDP connection, supply the port in the specified field. 
If a URL is entered in the *Logging Aggregator* field instead, its hostname portion is extracted as the hostname.

* *Logging Aggregator Type*: Click to select the aggregator service from the menu:

* *Log System Tracking Facts Individually*: Click the tooltip image:question_circle.png[Help,15,15] icon for additional information, such as whether or not you want to turn it on, or leave it off by default.
* *Logging Aggregator Protocol*: Click to select a connection type (protocol) to communicate with the log aggregator. 
Subsequent options vary depending on the selected protocol.
* *Logging Aggregator Level Threshold*: Select the level of severity you want the log handler to report.
* *TCP Connection Timeout*: Specify the connection timeout in seconds.
This option is only applicable to HTTPS and TCP log aggregator protocols.
* *Enable/disable HTTPS certificate verification*: Certificate verification is enabled by default for the HTTPS log protocol. 
Set the toggle to *OFF* if you do not want the log handler to verify the HTTPS certificate sent by the external log aggregator before establishing a connection.
* *Loggers to Send Data to the Log Aggregator Form*: All four types of data are pre-populated by default. 
Click the tooltip image:question_circle.png[Help,15,15] icon next to the field for additional information on each data type.
