= Requests and limits for task containers

You must set a value for the task container's CPU and memory resource limits. 
For each job that is run in an execution node, processing must occur on the control plane to schedule, launch and receive callback events for that job.  

For Operator deployments of {ControllerName}, this control plane capacity usage is tracked on the *controlplane* instance group, and the available capacity is determined based on the limits the user sets on the task container, using the *task_resource_requirements* field in the {ControllerName} specification, or in the OpenShift UI, when creating {ControllerName}.

You can also set memory and CPU resource limits that make sense for your cluster.
