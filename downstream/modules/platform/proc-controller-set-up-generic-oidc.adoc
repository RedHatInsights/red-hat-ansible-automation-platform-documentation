= Generic OIDC authentication

OpenID Connect (OIDC) uses the OAuth 2.0 framework. 
It enables third-party applications to verify the identity and obtain basic end-user information. 
The main difference between OIDC and SMAL is that SAML has a service provider (SP)-to-IdP trust relationship, whereas OIDC establishes the trust with the channel (HTTPS) that is used to obtain the security token. 
To obtain the credentials needed to setup OIDC with {ControllerName}, see the documentation from the IdP of your choice that has OIDC support.

.Procedure

. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[].
. Select *Generic OIDC settings* from the list of *Authentication* options.

* *OIDC Secret*: The client secret from your IdP.
* *OIDC Provider URL*: The URL for your OIDC provider.
* *Verify OIDC Provider Certificate*: Use the toggle to enable or disable the OIDC provider SSL certificate verification.

[NOTE]
====
Team and organization mappings for OIDC is currently not supported. 
The OIDC adapter does authentication only and not authorization. 
It is only capable of authenticating whether this user is who they say they are. 
It does not authorize what this user is enabled to do.
Configuring generic OIDC creates the UserID appended with an ID or key to differentiate the same user ID originating from two different sources and therefore, considered different users. 
So you get an ID of just the user name and the second is the username-<random number>.
====

.Verification
To verify that the authentication is configured correctly, logout of {ControllerName} and the login screen displays the OIDC logo to indicate it as a alternative method of logging into {ControllerName}:
