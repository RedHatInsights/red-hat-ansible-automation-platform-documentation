= Revoke an access token

You can revoke an access token by using the `/api/o/revoke-token/` endpoint.

Revoking an access token by this method is the same as deleting the token resource object, but it enables you to delete a token by providing its token value, and the associated `client_id` (and `client_secret` if the application is `confidential`). For example:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -X POST -d "token=rQONsve372fQwuc2pn76k3IHDCYpi7" \
-u "gwSPoasWSdNkMDtBN3Hu2WYQpPWCO9SwUEsKK22l:fI6ZpfocHYBGfm1tP92r0yIgCyfRdDQt0Tos9L8a4fNsJjQQMwp9569eIaUBsaVDgt2eiwOGe0bg5m5vCSstClZmtdy359RVx2rQK5YlIWyPlrolpt2LEpVeKXWaiybo" \
http://<controller>/api/o/revoke_token/ -i

[NOTE]
====
* The special OAuth 2 endpoints only support using the `x-www-form-urlencoded` *Content-type*, so as a result, none of the
`api/o/*` endpoints accept `application/json`.
* The *Allow External Users to Create Oauth2 Tokens* (`ALLOW_OAUTH2_FOR_EXTERNAL_USERS` in the API) setting is disabled by default. 
External users refer to users authenticated externally with a service such as LDAP, or any of the other SSO services. 
This setting ensures external users cannot create their own tokens. 
If you enable then disable it, any tokens created by external users in the meantime will still exist, and are not automatically revoked.
====

Alternatively, to revoke oauth 2 tokens, you can use the `manage` utility, see xref:ref-controller-revoke-oauth2-token[Revoke oauth2 tokens].

This setting can be configured at the system-level in the UI:

image:configure-controller-system-oauth2-tokens-toggle.png[image]

On success, a response of `200 OK` is displayed. 
Verify the deletion by checking whether the token is present in the `/api/v2/tokens/` endpoint.
