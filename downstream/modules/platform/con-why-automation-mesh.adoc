= Scale up your automation using {AutomationMesh}

The {AutomationMesh} component of the {PlatformName} simplifies the process of distributing automation across multi-site deployments. For enterprises with multiple isolated IT environments, {AutomationMesh} provides a consistent and reliable way to deploy and scale up automation across your execution nodes using a peer-to-peer mesh communication network.

Platform administrators can implement {AutomationMesh} by planning out a network of hybrid and control nodes, then editing the inventory file found in the {PlatformNameShort} installer to assign mesh-related values to each of their execution nodes.

For more information about {AutomationMesh} and the ways you can design your automation mesh for your environment, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_automation_mesh_guide/index[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform automation mesh guide].
