= Scale up your automation using {AutomationMesh}

The {AutomationMesh} component of the {PlatformName} simplifies the process of distributing automation across multi-site deployments. For enterprises with multiple isolated IT environments, {AutomationMesh} provides a consistent and reliable way to deploy and scale up automation across your execution nodes using a peer-to-peer mesh communication network.

When upgrading from version 1.x to the latest version of the {PlatformNameShort}, you will need to migrate the data from your legacy isolated nodes into execution nodes necessary for {AutomationMesh}. You can implement {AutomationMesh} by planning out a network of hybrid and control nodes, then editing the inventory file found in the {PlatformNameShort} installer to assign mesh-related values to each of your execution nodes.
