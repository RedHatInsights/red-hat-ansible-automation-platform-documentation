{PlatformName} uses a number of ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connection to the {PlatformName} server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not being blocked by a firewall.

The following tables provide the default {PlatformName} destination ports required for each application.

[NOTE]
The default destination ports and installer inventory listed below are configurable. If you choose to configure them to suit your environment, you may experience a change in behavior.
