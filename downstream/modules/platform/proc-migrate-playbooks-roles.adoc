= Migrating your Ansible playbooks and roles to Core 2.12

[role="_abstract"]

When you are migrating from non collection-based content to collection-based content, you should use Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCN) when using Ansible content collections in playbooks and roles. If the collection name is not defined, you may encounter behavioral changes within your environment.

Example playbook with FQCN:

----
- name: get some info
  amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_net_info:
    region: "{{ec2_region}}"
  register: all_the_info
  delegate_to: localhost
  run_once: true
----

If you are using ansible-core modules and are not calling a module from a different Collection, you should use the FQCN. In this case, you will use `ansible.builtin.copy` instead of `copy`.

Example module with FQCN:

----
- name: copy file with owner and permissions
  ansible.builtin.copy:
  src: /srv/myfiles/foo.conf
  dest: /etc/foo.conf
  owner: foo
  group: foo
  mode: '0644'
----
