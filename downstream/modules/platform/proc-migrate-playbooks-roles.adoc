= Migrating your Ansible playbooks and roles to Core 2.13

[role="_abstract"]

When you are migrating from non collection-based content to collection-based content, you should use the Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCN) in playbooks and roles to avoid unexpected behavior.

Example playbook with FQCN:

----
- name: get some info
  amazon.aws.ec2_vpc_net_info:
    region: "{{ec2_region}}"
  register: all_the_info
  delegate_to: localhost
  run_once: true
----

If you are using ansible-core modules and are not calling a module from a different Collection, you should use the FQCN `ansible.builtin.copy`.

Example module with FQCN:

----
- name: copy file with owner and permissions
  ansible.builtin.copy:
  src: /srv/myfiles/foo.conf
  dest: /etc/foo.conf
  owner: foo
  group: foo
  mode: '0644'
----
