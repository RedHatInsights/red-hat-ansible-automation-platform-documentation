= Declaring variables

The values of string variables are declared in quotes. 
For example:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password='<password>'
----

When declared in a `:vars` section, INI values are interpreted as strings. 
For example, `var=FALSE` creates a string equal to `FALSE`. 
Unlike host lines, `:vars` sections accept only a single entry per line, so everything after the `=` must be the value for the entry.
//When declared inline with the host, INI values are interpreted as Python literal structures (strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, None). 
Host lines accept multiple `key=value` parameters per line. 
Therefore they need a way to indicate that a space is part of a value rather than a separator. 
Values that contain whitespace can be quoted (single or double). 
See the Python shlex parsing rules for details.

If a variable value set in an INI inventory must be a certain type (for example, a string or a boolean value), always specify the type with a filter in your task. 
Do not rely on types set in INI inventories when consuming variables.

[NOTE]
====
Consider using YAML format for inventory sources to avoid confusion on the actual type of a variable. The YAML inventory plugin processes variable values consistently and correctly.
====

If a parameter value in the Ansible inventory file contains special characters, such as #, { or }, you must double-escape the value (that is enclose the value in both single and double quotation marks). 

For example, to use `mypasswordwith#hashsigns` as a value for the variable `pg_password`, declare it as `pg_password='"mypasswordwith#hashsigns"'` in the Ansible host inventory file.
