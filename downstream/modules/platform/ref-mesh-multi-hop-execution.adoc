[id="mesh-multi-hop-execution"]

= Multi-hopped execution node

[role="_abstract"]

In this configuration, resilient controller nodes are peered with resilient local execution nodes.
Resilient local hop nodes are peered with the controller nodes.
A remote execution node and a remote hop node are peered with the local hop nodes.

You can use this setup if you need to run automation in a DMZ network from a remote network.

The following image displays the topology of this mesh network.

//dotfile for image: /downloads/snippets/mesh-multi-hop.dot
image::mesh-multi-hop.png["The topology map of the configuration consists of an automation controller group, a local execution group, a hop node group, and a remote execution node group. The automation controller group consists of three control nodes: aap_c_1, aap_c_2, and aap_c_3. The local execution nodes are aap_e_1 and aap_e_2. Every control node is peered to every local execution node. The hop node group contains two hop nodes, aap_h_1 and aap_h_2. It is peered to the controller group. The remote execution node group contains one execution node, aap_e_3. It is peered to the hop node group. A remote hop node group, consisting of node aap_h_3, is peered with the local hop node group. An execution node, aap_e_4, is peered with the remote hop group"]

The `[automationcontroller:vars]` stanza sets the node types for all nodes in the control plane and defines how the control nodes peer to the local execution nodes:

* All nodes in the control plane are automatically peered to one another.
* All nodes in the control plane are peered with all local execution nodes.

The `[local_hop:vars]` stanza peers all nodes in the `[local_hop]` group with all the control nodes.

If the name of a group of nodes begins with `instance_group_`, the installer recognises it as an instance group and adds it to the {PlatformNameShort} user interface.
