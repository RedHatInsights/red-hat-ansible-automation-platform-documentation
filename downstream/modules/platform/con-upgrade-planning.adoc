////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: con-my-concept-module-a.adoc
* ID: [id="con-my-concept-module-a_{context}"]
* Title: = My concept module A
////

////
The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
////

[id="con-my-concept-module-a_{context}"]

////
The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID so you can include it multiple times in the same guide.

= Upgrade planning

[role="_abstract"]
This section covers changes that you should keep in mind as you attempt to upgrade your {ControllerName} instance


- Even if you already have a valid license from a previous version, you must still provide your credentials or a subscriptions manifest again upon upgrading to {ControllerName} 3.8. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/import_license.html[Import a subscription] in the Automation Controller User Guide.
- If you need to upgrade Red Hat Enterprise Linux and {ControllerName}, you will need to do a backup and restore of your {ControllerName} data. Refer to link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.3/html/installandreference/upgrade_tower.html#ir-upgrade-existing[Upgrading an Existing Controller Installation] for further detail.
- Clustered upgrades require special attention to instance and instance groups prior to starting the upgrade. Refer to the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.3/html/quickinstall/install_script.html#setting-up-the-inventory-file[Setting up the inventory file] and see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.3/html/administration/clustering.html#clustering[Clustering] for details.
- Prior versions of Ansible Tower used the variable name `rabbitmq_host` during installation. If you are upgrading from a previous version of Tower, and you previously specified `rabbitmq_host` in your inventory, simply rename `rabbitmq_host` to `routable_hostname` before upgrading. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/3.8.3/html/administration/clustering.html#clustering[Clustering] for details.
