////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: con-my-concept-module-a.adoc
* ID: [id="con-my-concept-module-a_{context}"]
* Title: = My concept module A
////

////
The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
////

[id="con-my-concept-module-a_{context}"]

////
The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID so you can include it multiple times in the same guide.

= Upgrade planning

[role="_abstract"]
Depending on your installation, there may be several changes to consider as you attempt to upgrade your {PlatformName}.

.Upgrading {ControllerName}
If you plan on upgrading your {ControllerName} instance along with your {PlatformNameShort}, review the following information:

- Even if you already have a valid license from a previous version, you still must provide your credentials or a subscriptions manifest upon upgrading to the latest version of {ControllerName}. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/import_license.html[Import a subscription] in the Automation Controller User Guide.
- If you need to upgrade Red Hat Enterprise Linux and {ControllerName}, you will need to do a backup and restore of your {ControllerName} data. Refer to link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/backup_restore.html#ag-backup-restore[Back up and restoring Tower] for further detail.
- Clustered upgrades require special attention to instance and instance groups prior to starting the upgrade. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/clustering.html#ag-clustering[Clustering] for details.
