. Use the *Source Variables* field to specify parameters used by the `foreman` inventory source. 
Enter variables using either JSON or YAML syntax. 
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.

If you encounter an issue with the {ControllerName} inventory not having the "related groups" from Satellite, you might need to define these variables in the inventory source. 
For more information, see xref:controller-rh-satellite[Red Hat Satellite 6].
