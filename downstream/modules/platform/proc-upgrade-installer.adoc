= Upgrading to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}

To upgrade your instance of Ansible Tower to {PlatformNameShort} {PlatformVers}, copy the `inventory` file from your original Tower instance to your new Tower instance and run the installer. The {PlatformName} installer detects a pre-{PlatformVers} and offers an upgraded inventory file to continue with the upgrade process:

. Download the latest installer for {PlatformName} from the link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480[Red Hat Customer Portal].
. Extract the files:
+
----
$ tar xvzf ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest-version>.tar.gz
----
. Navigate into your {PlatformNameShort} installation directory:
+
----
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest-version>/
----
. Copy the `inventory` file from your original instance into the directory of the latest installer:
+
----
$ cp ansible-tower-setup-3.8.x.x/inventory ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest-version>
----
. Run the `setup.sh` script:
+
----
$ ./setup.sh
----
+
The setup script pauses and indicates that a "pre-2.x" inventory file was detected, but offers a new file called `inventory.new.ini` allowing you to continue to upgrade your original instance.

. Open `inventory.new.ini` with a text editor.
+
NOTE: By running the setup script, the Installer modified a few fields from your original inventory file, such as renaming [tower] to [automationcontroller].
. Modify the newly generated `inventory.new.ini` file to configure your automation mesh by assigning relevant variables, nodes, and relevant node-to-node peer connections:
+
NOTE: The design of your automation mesh topology depends on the automation needs of your environment. The example below offers one possible scenario for automation mesh design.

.Example inventory file with a standard control plane consisting of three nodes utilizing hop nodes:
----
[automationcontroller]
control-plane-1.example.com
control-plane-2.example.com
control-plane-3.example.com

[automationcontroller:vars]
node_type=control <1>
peers=execution_nodes <2>


[execution_nodes]
execution-node-1.example.com peers=execution-node-2.example.com
execution-node-2.example.com peers=execution-node-3.example.com
execution-node-3.example.com peers=execution-node-4.example.com
execution-node-4.example.com peers=execution-node-5.example.com node_type=hop
execution-node-5.example.com peers=execution-node-6.example.com node_type=hop <3>
execution-node-6.example.com peers=execution-node-7.example.com
execution-node-7.example.com

[execution_nodes:vars]
node_type=execution
----
<1> Specifies a control node that runs project and inventory updates and system jobs, but not regular jobs. Execution capabilities are disabled on these nodes.
<2> Specifies peer relationships for node-to-node connections in the `[execution_nodes]` group.
<3> Specifies hop nodes that route traffic to other execution nodes. Hop nodes cannot execute automation.
. Add the following field to import an existing {HubName} API token:
+
----
automationhub_api_token=<api_token>
----
.. To generate a new {HubName} API token instead, add the following field:
+
----
generate_automationhub_token=
----
. Once you have finished configuring your `inventory.new.ini` for automation mesh, run the setup script using `inventory.new.ini`:
+
----
$ ./setup.sh -i inventory.new.ini -e @credentials.yml -- --ask-vault-pass
----
. Once the installation completes, verify that your {PlatformNameShort} has been installed successfully by logging in to the {PlatformNameShort} dashboard UI across all automation controller nodes.
