= Persisting data from auto runs

Consider the local Automation Controller filesystem as counterproductive since that ties the data to that host. If you have a multi-node cluster, then you can contact a different host each time causing issues if you are creating workflows that depend upon each other and created directories. For example, if a directory was only created in one node, while another node runs the playbook, the results would be inconsistent.

The solution is to use some form of shared storage solution, like Amazon S3, Gist, or a role to rsync data to your data endpoint. 

The option exists of injecting data or a configuration into a container at runtime. This can be achieved using the automation controllerâ€™s isolated jobs path option.

This provides a way to mount directories and files into an execution environment at runtime. This is achieved through the automation mesh, utilizing ansible-runner to inject them into a Podman container to launch the automation. What follows are some of the use cases for using isolated job paths:

* Providing SSL certificates at runtime, rather than baking them into an execution environment.

* Passing runtime configuration data, such as SSH config settings, but could be anything you want to provide and use during automation.

* Reading and writing to files used before, during and after automation runs.

There are caveats to utilization:

* The volume mount has to pre-exist on all nodes capable of automation execution (so hybrid control plane nodes and all execution nodes).

* Where SELinux is enabled (Ansible Automation Platform default) beware of file permissions.

** This is important since rootless podman is run on non-OCP based installs.

The caveats need to be carefully observed. It is highly recommended to read up on rootless Podman and the Podman volume mount runtime options, the [:OPTIONS] part of the isolated job paths, as this is what is used inside Ansible Automation Platform 2.
