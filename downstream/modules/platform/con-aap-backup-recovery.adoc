[role="_abstract"]
Red Hat recommends backing up deployments of {PlatformName} in your {OCP} environment to prevent data loss.

A backup resource of your {PlatformName} deployment includes the following:

* Custom deployment of specific values in the `spec` section of the {PlatformNameShort} custom resource object
* Back up of the `postgresql` database
* `secret_key`, `admin_password`, and `broadcast_websocket` secrets
* Database configuration

[NOTE]
====
Be sure to secure your backup resources because they can include sensitive information.
