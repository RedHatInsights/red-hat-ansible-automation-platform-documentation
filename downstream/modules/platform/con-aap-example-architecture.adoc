= Example {PlatformNameShort} architecture

The architecture for this example includes two sites, _Ansible Site 1_ and _Ansible Site 2_ for high availability. Each site consists of the following:

* A three node automation controller cluster with one PostgreSQL database
* A three node automation hub cluster with one PostgreSQL database
* Two execution nodes per automation controller cluster
* Access to console.redhat.com services such as {InsightsShort} and {CatalogName}

To achieve high availability for the PostgreSQL databases, configuration as code along with Git webhooks are used when push or merge events are triggered on a Git repository that configure the specified event on both _Ansible Site 1_ and _Ansible Site 2_.

To ensure logging consistency, a highly available centralized logging environment is installed and used by both {PlatformNameShort} environments.

The example focuses on the deployment of {PlatformNameShort} using automation mesh on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 x86_64. The key components covered within this example architecture include the following:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4
* {PlatformNameShort}
* {AutomationMesh}
* {PrivateHubName}
