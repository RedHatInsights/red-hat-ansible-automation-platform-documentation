= Example {PlatformNameShort} architecture

The {PlatformName} {PlatformVers} reference architecture provides an example setup of a standard deployment of {PlatformNameShort} using automation mesh on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The deployment shown takes advantage of the following key components to provide a simple, secure and flexible method of handling your automation workloads, a central location for content collections, and automated resolution of IT requests.

{ControllerNameStart}:: Provides the control plane for automation through its UI, Restful API, RBAC workflows and CI/CD integrations.
{AutomationMeshStart}:: Is an overlay network that provides the ability to ease the distribution of work across a large and dispersed collection of workers through nodes that establish peer-to-peer connections with each other using existing networks.
{PrivateHubNameStart}:: Provides automation developers the ability to collaborate and publish their own automation content and streamline delivery of Ansible code within their organization.
// Removing EDA for the 2.3 branch as it's only supported in 2.4 and later
//Event-Driven Ansible (EDA):: Provides the event-handling capability needed to automate time-consuming tasks and respond to changing conditions in any IT domain.

The architecture for this example consists of the following:

* A two node {ControllerName} cluster
* An optional hop node to connect {ControllerName} to execution nodes
* A two node automation hub cluster
//* A single node EDA controller cluster
* A single PostgreSQL database connected to the {ControllerName}, {HubName}, and EDA controller clusters
* Two execution nodes per automation controller cluster
