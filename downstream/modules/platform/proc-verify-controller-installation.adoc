= Verifying {ControllerName} installation

[role="_abstract"]
After the installation completes, you can verify your {ControllerName} has been installed successfully by logging in with the admin credentials you inserted into the `inventory` file.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the IP address specified for the {ControllerName} node in the `inventory` file.
. Log in with the Admin credentials you set in the `inventory` file.

[NOTE]
====
The {ControllerName} server is accessible from port 80 (*https://<TOWER_SERVER_NAME>/*) but will redirect to port 443 so 443 needs to be available also.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the installation fails and you are a customer who has purchased a valid license for {PlatformName}, please contact Ansible via the Red Hat Customer portal at https://access.redhat.com/.
====

Upon a successful login to {ControllerName}, your installation of {PlatformName} {PlatformVers} is now complete.
