= Accessing the {HubName} user interface

You can access the {HubName} interface once all pods have successfully launched.

. Navigate to menu:Networking[Routes].
. Under *Location*, click on the URL for your {HubName} instance.

The {HubName} user interface launches where you can sign in with the administrator credentials specified during the operator configuration process.

[NOTE]
====
If you did not specify an administrator password during configuration, one was automatically created for you. To locate this password, go to your project, select menu:Workloads[Secrets] and open controller-admin-password. From there you can copy the password and paste it into the {HubNameStart} password field.
