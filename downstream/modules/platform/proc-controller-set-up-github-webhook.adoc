= Setting up a GitHub webhook

{ControllerNameStart} has the ability to run jobs based on a triggered webhook event coming in. 
Job status information (pending, error, success) can be sent back only for pull request events. 
If you do not need {ControllerName} to post job statuses back to the webhook service, go directly to step 3.

.Procedure

. Generate a _ Personal Access Token _ (PAT) for use with {ControllerName}:
.. In the profile settings of your GitHub account, select *Settings*.
.. From the navigation panel, select menu:<> Developer Settings[].
.. On the *Developer Settings* page, select *Personal access tokens*.
.. From the *Personal access tokens* screen, click btn:[Generate a personal access token].
.. When prompted, enter your GitHub account password to continue.
.. In the *Note* field, enter a brief description about what this PAT is used for.
.. In the *Select scopes* fields, check the boxes next to *repo:status*, *repo_deployment*, and *public_repo*. 
The automation webhook only needs repository scope access, with the exception of invites.
For more information, see link:https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps[Scopes for OAuth apps documentation].
.. Click btn:[Generate token].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When the token is generated, ensure that you copy the PAT, as you need it in step 2. 
You cannot access this token again in GitHub.
====
+
. Use the PAT to optionally create a GitHub credential:
.. Go to your instance, and xref:ref-controller-credential-gitHub-pat[Create a new credential for the GitHub PAT] using the generated token.
.. Make note of the name of this credential, as you use it in the job template that posts back to GitHub.
