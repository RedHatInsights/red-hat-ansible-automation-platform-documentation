= Configuring a reverse proxy

[role="_abstract"]
You can support a reverse proxy server configuration by adding `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` to the *REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS* field in your {ControllerName} settings. The ``X-Forwarded-For`` (XFF) HTTP header field identifies the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer.


.Procedure

. On your {ControllerName}, navigate to menu:Settings[Miscellaneous System].
. In the *REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS* field, enter the following values:
+
----
[
  "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR",
  "REMOTE_ADDR",
  "REMOTE_HOST"
]
----
. Add the lines below to ``/etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py`` to ensure the application uses the correct headers:

----
USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT = True
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True 
----
