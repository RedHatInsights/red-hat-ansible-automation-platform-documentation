= Websocket configuration for {ControllerName}

[role="_abstract"]
{ControllerNameStart} nodes are interconnected through websockets to distribute all websocket-emitted messages throughout your system. This configuration setup enables any browser client websocket to subscribe to any job that might be running on any {ControllerName} node. Websocket clients are not routed to specific {ControllerName} nodes. Instead, any {ControllerName} node can handle any websocket request and each {ControllerName} node must know about all websocket messages destined for all clients.

{ControllerNameStart} automatically handles discovery of other {ControllerName} nodes through the Instance record in the database.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your {ControllerName} nodes are designed to broadcast websocket traffic across a private, trusted subnet (and not the open Internet). Therefore, if you turn off HTTPS for websocket broadcasting, the websocket traffic, comprised mostly of Ansible playbook stdout, is sent unencrypted between {ControllerName} nodes.
