= Multiple hybrid nodes inventory file example

[role="_abstract"]
This example inventory file deploys a control plane consisting of multiple hybrid nodes. The nodes in the control plane are automatically peered to one another.

[source,yaml]
-----
[automationcontroller]
aap_c_1.example.com
aap_c_2.example.com
aap_c_3.example.com

The following image displays the topology of this mesh network.

image::mesh-multiple-hybrid-nodes.png["The topology map of the multiple hybrid node mesh configuration consists of an automation controller group. The automation controller group contains three hybrid nodes: aap_c_1, aap_c_2, and aap_c_3. The control nodes are peered to one another as follows: aap_c_3 is peered to aap_c_1 and aap_c_1 is peered to aap_c_2."]

The default `node_type` for nodes in the control plane is `hybrid`.
You can explicitly set the `node_type` of individual nodes to `hybrid` in the `[automationcontroller group]`:

[source,yaml]
-----
[automationcontroller]
aap_c_1.example.com node_type=hybrid
aap_c_2.example.com node_type=hybrid
aap_c_3.example.com node_type=hybrid

-----

Alternatively, you can set the `node_type` of all nodes in the `[automationcontroller]` group.
When you add new nodes to the control plane they are automatically set to hybrid nodes.

[source,yaml]
-----
[automationcontroller]
aap_c_1.example.com
aap_c_2.example.com
aap_c_3.example.com

[automationcontroller:vars]
node_type=hybrid

-----

If you think that you might add control nodes to your control plane in future, it is better to define a separate group for the hybrid nodes, and set the `node_type` for the group:

[source,yaml]
-----
[automationcontroller]
aap_c_1.example.com
aap_c_2.example.com
aap_c_3.example.com

[hybrid_group]
aap_c_1.example.com
aap_c_2.example.com
aap_c_3.example.com

[hybrid_group:vars]
node_type=hybrid
