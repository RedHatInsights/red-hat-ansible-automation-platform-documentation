[role="_abstract"]
{AutomationMeshStart} is an overlay network intended to ease the distribution of work across a large and dispersed collection of workers through nodes that establish peer-to-peer connections with each other using existing networks.

{AutomationMeshStart} provides:

* Dynamic cluster capacity that scales independently, allowing you to create, register, group, ungroup and deregister nodes with minimal downtime.
* Control and execution plane separation that enables you to scale playbook execution capacity independently from control plane capacity.
* Deployment choices that are resilient to latency, reconfigurable without outage, and that dynamically re-reroute to choose a different path when outages exist.
* Mesh routing changes.
* Connectivity that includes bi-directional, multi-hopped mesh communication possibilities which are Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant.
