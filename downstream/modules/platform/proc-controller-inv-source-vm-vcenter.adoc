[NOTE]
====
VMWare properties have changed from lower case to camel case.
{ControllerNameStart} provides aliases for the top-level keys, but lower case keys in nested properties have been discontinued.
For a list of valid and supported properties, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/vmware/docsite/vmware_scenarios/vmware_inventory_vm_attributes.html[Using Virtual machine attributes in VMware dynamic inventory plugin].
