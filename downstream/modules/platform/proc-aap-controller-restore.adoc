= Recovering the {ControllerNameStart} deployment

[role=_abstract]
Use this procedure to restore a previous controller deployment from an AutomationControllerBackup. The deployment name you provide will be the name of the new AutomationController custom resource that will be created.

[NOTE]
====
The name specified for the new AutomationController custom resource must not match an existing deployment or the recovery process will fail. If the name specified does match an existing deployment, see xref:aap-troubleshoot-backup-recover[Troubleshooting] for steps to resolve the issue.
