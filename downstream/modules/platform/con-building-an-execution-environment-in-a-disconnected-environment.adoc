= Building an Execution Environment in a Disconnected Environment

When building a custom execution environment, the ansible-builder tool defaults
to downloading the following requirements from the internet:

* Ansible Galaxy (galaxy.ansible.com) or Automation Hub (cloud.redhat.com) for any collections added to the EE image.
* PyPI (pypi.org) for any python packages required as collection dependencies.
* The UBI repositories (cdn.redhat.com) for updating any UBI-based EE images.
** The RHEL repositories might also be needed to meet certain collection requirements.
* registry.redhat.io for access to the ansible-builder-rhel8 container image.

Building an EE image in a disconnected environment requires a subset of all of these mirrored, or otherwise made available on the disconnected network.
See xref:importing-collections-into-private-automation-hub_disconnected-installation[Importing Collections into Private Automation Hub] for information on importing collections from Galaxy or Automation Hub into a private automation hub.

Mirrored PyPI content once transferred into the high-side network can be made available using a web server or an artifact repository like Nexus.

The UBI repositories can be mirrored on the low-side using a tool like `reposync`, imported to the disconnected environment, and made available from Satellite or a simple web server (since the content is freely redistributable).

The `ansible-builder-rhel8` container image can be imported into a private automation hub in the same way a custom EE can be imported.
See xref:approving-the-imported-collection_disconnected-installation[Transferring a Custom EE Images Across a Disconnected Boundary] for details substituting `localhost/custom-ee` for
`registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-21/ansible-builder-rhel8`. This will make the ansible-builder-rhel8 image available in the private automation hub registry along with the default EE images.

Once all of the prerequisites are available on the high-side network,
ansible-builder and podman can be used to create a custom execution environment image.
