An Activity Stream shows all changes for a particular object. 
For each change, the Activity Stream shows the time of the event, the user that initiated the event, and the action. 
The information displayed varies depending on the type of event. 
Click the btn:[Examine] image:examine.png[View Event Details,15,15] icon to display the event log for the change.

You can filter the Activity Stream by the initiating user, by system (if it was system initiated), or by any related object, such as a credential, job template, or schedule.

The Activity Stream on the main Dashboard shows the Activity Stream for the entire instance. 
Most pages permit viewing an activity stream filtered for that specific object.
