= Google OAuth2 settings

To set up social authentication for Google, you must obtain an OAuth2 key and secret for a web application. 
To do this, you must first create a project and set it up with Google. 

For instructions, see link:https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849[Setting up OAuth 2.0] in the Google API Console Help documentation.

If you have already completed the setup process, you can access those credentials by going to the Credentials section of the
link:https://console.developers.google.com/[Google API Manager Console]. 
The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.

.Procedure
. On the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[].
. On the *Settings* page, select *Google OAuth 2 settings* from the list of Authentication options.
+
The *Google OAuth2 Callback URL* field is already pre-populated and non-editable.

. The following fields are also pre-populated. 
If not, use the credentials Google supplied during the web application setup process, and look for the values with the same format as the ones shown in the example below:

* Click *Edit* and copy and paste Google's Client ID into the *Google OAuth2 Key* field.
* Copy and paste Google's Client secret into the *Google OAuth2 Secret* field.

. For more information on completing the mapping fields, see xref:ref-controller-organization-mapping[Organization mapping] and xref:ref-controller-team-mapping[Team mapping].
. Click btn:[Save].

.Verification
To verify that the authentication was configured correctly, logout of {controllerName}.
The login screen displays the Google logo to indicate it as a alternate method of logging into {ControllerName}.
