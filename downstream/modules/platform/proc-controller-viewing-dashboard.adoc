The last item in the navigation panel is *Settings*, which provides access to {ControllerName} configuration settings.

The *Settings* page allows administrators to configure the following settings:

* Authentication
* Jobs
* System-level attributes
* Customize the UI, and product license information

For more information, see link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/administration/configure_tower_in_tower.html#ag-configure-tower[Controller Configuration] in the Automation Controller Administration Guide.

To launch a simple playbook, you must set up a number of configuration options. 
Completing the getting started configuration tasks now ensures that {ControllerName} is configured properly and permits easier executions of more involved playbooks later on.
