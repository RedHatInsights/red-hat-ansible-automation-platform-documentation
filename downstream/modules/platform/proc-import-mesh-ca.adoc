= Importing a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate

A Certificate Authority (CA) verifies and signs individual node certificates in an {AutomationMesh} environment. You can provide your own CA by specifying the path to the certificate and the private RSA key file in the `inventory` file of your {PlatformName} installer.

NOTE: The {PlatformNameShort} installation program generates a CA if you do not provide one.

.Procedure

. Open the `inventory` file for editing.
. Add the `mesh_ca_keyfile` variable and specify the full path to the CA certificate file (`.crt`).
. Add the `mesh_ca_certfile` variable and specify the full path to the private RSA key (`.key`).
. Save the changes to the inventory file.

.Example
[subs="+quotes"]
----
[all:vars]
mesh_ca_keyfile=/tmp/__<mesh_CA>__.key
mesh_ca_certfile=/tmp/__<mesh_CA>__.crt
----

With the CA files added to the inventory file, run the installer to apply the CA. This process copies the CA on each control and execution node on your mesh network. By default, the certfile and keyfile will be added to `/etc/receptor/tls/ca/`.
