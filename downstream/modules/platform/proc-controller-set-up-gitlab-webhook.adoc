= Setting up a GitLab webhook

{ControllerNameStart} has the ability to run jobs based on a triggered webhook event coming in. 
Job status information (pending, error, success) can be sent back only for pull request events. 
If {ControllerName} is not required to post job statuses back to the webhook service, go directly to step 3.

.Procedure
. Generate a _Personal Access Token_ (PAT) for use with {ControllerName}:
.. From the navigation panel in GitLab, select your avatar and menu:Edit profile[].
.. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access tokens[].
.. Complete the following fields:
* *Token name*: Enter a brief description about what this PAT is used for.
* *Expiration date*: Skip this field unless you want to set an expiration date for your webhook.
* *Select scopes*: Select those that are applicable to your integration. 
For {ControllerName}, *api* is the only selection necessary.
.. Click btn:[Create personal access token].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When the token is generated, ensure that you copy the PAT, as you need it in step 2. 
You cannot access this token again in GitLab.
====
+
. Use the PAT to optionally create a GitLab credential:
.. Go to your instance, and xref:ref-controller-credential-gitLab-pat[create a new credential for the GitLab PAT] using the generated token.
.. Make note of the name of this credential, as you use it in the job template that posts back to GitLab.

.. Go to the job template with which you want to enable webhooks, and select the webhook service and credential you created in the preceding step.

+
.. Click btn:[Save]. Your job template is set up to post back to GitLab.
. Go to a GitLab repository where you want to configure webhooks.
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[Integrations].
. To complete the *Add webhook* page, you must check the *Enable Webhook* option in a job template or workflow job template. 
For more information, see step 3 in both xref:controller-create-job-template[Creating a job template] and xref:controller-create-workflow-template[Creating a workflow template].
. Complete the following fields:
* *URL*: Copy the contents of the *Webhook URL* from the job template and paste it here.
The results are sent to this address from GitLab.
* *Secret Token*: Copy the contents of the *Webhook Key* from the job template and paste it here.
* *Trigger*: Select the types of events you want to trigger a webhook. 
Any such event will trigger the job or workflow. 
To have job status (pending, error, success) sent back to GitLab, you must select *Merge request events* in the *Trigger* section.
* *SSL verification*: Leave *Enable SSL verification* selected.
. Click btn:[Add webhook].
. When your webhook is configured, it is displayed in the list *Project Webhooks* for your repository, along with the ability to test events, edit or delete the webhook. 
Testing a webhook event displays the results on each page whether it succeeded or failed.
