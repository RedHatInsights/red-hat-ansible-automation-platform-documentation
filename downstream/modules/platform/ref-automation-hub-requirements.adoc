[NOTE]
====
{PrivateHubNameStart}

If you install {PrivateHubname} from an internal address, and have a certificate which only encompasses the external address, this can result in an installation which cannot be used as container registry without certificate issues. 

To avoid this, use the `automationhub_main_url` inventory variable with a value like \https://pah.example.com linking to the {PrivateHubName} node in the installation inventory file.

This adds the external address to `/etc/pulp/settings.py`.

This implies that you only want to use the external address.

For information on inventory file variables, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/appendix-inventory-files-vars[Inventory File Variables] in the _{PlatformName} Installation Guide_.
