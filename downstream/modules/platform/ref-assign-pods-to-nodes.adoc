= Assigning pods to specific nodes

You can constrain the controller pods created by the operator to run on a certain subset of nodes.

* `node_selector` and `postgres_selector` constrain the controller pods to run only on the nodes that match all the specified key, or value, pairs.
* `tolerations` and `postgres_tolerations` enable the controller pods to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints. 
See Taints and Tolerations in the Kubernetes documentation for further details.

The following table shows the settings and fields that can be set on the {ControllerName}'s specification section of the YAML (or using the Openshift UI form).

| `postgres_image` | Path of the image to pull | postgres
| `postgres_image_version` | Image version to pull | 13
| `node_selector` | AutomationController pods’ nodeSelector | “”’’
| `topology_spread_constraints` | AutomationController pods’ topologySpreadConstraints | “”’’
| `tolerations` |  AutomationController pods’ tolerations | “”’’

`topology_spread_constraints` can help optimize spreading your control plane pods across the compute nodes that match your node selector. 
For example, with the `maxSkew` parameter of this option set to `100`, this means maximally spread across available nodes. 
So if there are 3 matching compute nodes and 3 pods, 1 pod will be assigned to each compute node. 
This parameter helps prevent the control plane pods from competing for resources with each other.
