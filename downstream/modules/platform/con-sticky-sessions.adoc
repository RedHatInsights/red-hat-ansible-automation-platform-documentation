= Enable sticky sessions

[role="_abstract"]
By default, an Application Load Balancer routes each request independently to a registered target based on the chosen load-balancing algorithm. To avoid authentication errors when running multiple instances of {HubName} behind a load balancer, you must enable sticky sessions. Enabling sticky sessions sets a custom application cookie that matches the cookie configured on the load balancer to enable stickiness. This custom cookie can include any of the cookie attributes required by the application.
