= Configuring and linking secret lookups

When pulling a secret from a third-party system, you are in essence linking credential fields to external systems. 
To link a credential field to a value stored in an external system, select the external credential corresponding to that system and provide `metadata` to look up the desired value. The metadata input fields are part of the `external credential type` definition of the `source credential`.

{ControllerNameStart} provides a `credential plugin` interface for developers, integrators, system administrators, and power-users with the ability to add new external credential types to extend it to support other secret management systems. 

For more information, see the development documents for
link:https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/docs/credentials/credential_plugins.md[Credential plugins].

Use the following procedure to use {ControllerName} to configure and use each of the supported third-party secret management systems.

.Procedure
. Create an external credential for authenticating with the secret management system. At minimum, provide a name for the external
credential and select one of the following for the *Credential Type*:

* xref:ref-centrify-vault-lookup[Centrify Vault Credential Provider Lookup]
* xref:ref-cyberark-ccp-lookup[CyberArk Central Credential Provider (CCP) Lookup]
* xref:ref-cyberark-conjur-lookup[CyberArk Conjur Secrets Manager Lookup]
* xref:ref-hashicorp-vault-lookup[HashiCorp Vault Secret Lookup]
* xref:ref-hashicorp-signed-ssh[HashiCorp Vault Signed SSH]

* xref:ref-thycotic-devops-vault[Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault]
* xref:ref-thycotic-secret-server[Thycotic Secret Server]

. Navigate to the credential form of the target credential and link one or more input fields to the external credential along with metadata for locating the secret in the external system. 
In this example, the _Demo Credential_ is the target credential.
. For any of the fields that follow the *Type Details* area that you want to link to the external credential, click the image:leftkey.png[Link,15,15] icon in the input field. 
You are prompted to set the input source to use to retrieve your secret information.

. Select the credential you want to link to, and click btn:[Next]. 
This takes you to the *Metadata* tab of the input source. 
This example shows the Metadata prompt for HashiVault Secret Lookup. 
Metadata is specific to the input source you select. 
For more information, see the xref:ref-controller-metadata-credential-input[Metadata for credential input sources] table.

. Click btn:[Test] to verify connection to the secret management system. 
If the lookup is unsuccessful, an error message similar to the following displays:
+
image:credentials-link-metadata-test-error.png[Exception]

. Click btn:[OK]. 
You are returned to the *Details* screen of your target credential. 
. Repeat these steps, starting with Step 3 to complete the remaining input fields for the target credential. 
By linking the information in this manner, {ControllerName} retrieves sensitive information, such as username, password, keys, certificates, and tokens from the third-party management systems and populates the remaining fields of the target credential form with that data.
. If necessary, supply any information manually for those fields that do not use linking as a way of retrieving sensitive information. 
For more information about each of the fields, see the appropriate xref:ref-controller-credential-types[Credential Types].
. Click btn:[Save].
