Container credentials require the following inputs:

* *OpenShift or Kubernetes API Endpoint* (required): The endpoint used to connect to an OpenShift or Kubernetes container.
* *API Authentication Bearer Token* (required): The token used to authenticate the connection.
* Optional: *Verify SSL*: You can check this option to verify the server's SSL certificate is valid and trusted. 
Environments that use internal or private _Certificate Authority_ (CA) must leave this option unchecked to disable verification.
* *Certificate Authority Data*: Include the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE` lines when pasting the certificate, if provided.

A ContainerGroup is a type of InstanceGroup that has an associated Credential that enables connection to an OpenShift cluster. 
To set up a container group, you must have the following:

* A namespace you can launch into (every cluster has a “default” namespace, but you may want to use a specific namespace).
* A service account that has the roles that enable it to launch and manage Pods in this namespace.
* If you use {ExecEnvShort}s in a private registry, and have a Container Registry credential associated with them in {ControllerName}, the service account also requires the roles to get, create, and delete secrets in the namespace. 
+
If you do not want to give these roles to the service account, you can pre-create the `ImagePullSecrets` and specify them on the pod spec for the ContainerGroup. 
In this case, the {ExecEnvShort} must not have a Container Registry credential associated, or {ControllerName} attempts to create the secret for you in the namespace.
* A token associated with that service account (OpenShift or Kubernetes Bearer Token)
* A CA certificate associated with the cluster
