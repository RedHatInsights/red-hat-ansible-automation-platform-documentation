Source Control credentials require the following inputs:

* *Username*: The username to use in conjunction with the source control system.
* *Password*: The password to use in conjunction with the source control system.
* *SCM Private Key*: Copy or drag-and-drop the actual SSH Private Key to be used to authenticate the user to the source control system through SSH.
* *Private Key Passphrase*: If the SSH Private Key used is protected by a passphrase, you can configure a Key Passphrase for the private key.

[NOTE]
====
Source Control credentials cannot be configured as *Prompt on launch*.

If you are using a GitHub account for a Source Control credential and you have _Two Factor Authenication_ (2FA) enabled on your account, you must use your Personal Access Token in the password field rather than your account password.
