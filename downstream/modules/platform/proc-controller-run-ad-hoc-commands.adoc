= Running Ad Hoc commands

_Ad hoc_ refers to using Ansible to perform a quick command, using /usr/bin/ansible, rather than the orchestration language, which is /usr/bin/ansible-playbook. 
An example of an ad hoc command might be rebooting 50 machines in your infrastructure. 
Anything you can do ad hoc can be accomplished by writing a Playbook. 
Playbooks can also glue lots of other operations together.

Use the following procedure to run an ad hoc command:

.Procedure
. Select an inventory source from the list of hosts or groups. 
The inventory source can be a single group or host, a selection of multiple hosts, or a selection of multiple groups.

* *Arguments*: Provide arguments to be used with the module you selected.
* *Limit*: Enter the limit used to target hosts in the inventory. 
To target all hosts in the inventory enter `all` or `*`, or leave the field blank. 
This is automatically populated with whatever was selected in the previous view before clicking the launch button.
* *Machine Credential*: Select the credential to use when accessing the remote hosts to run the command. 
Choose the credential containing the username and SSH key or password that Ansbile needs to log into the remote hosts.
* *Verbosity*: Select a verbosity level for the standard output.
* *Forks*: If needed, select the number of parallel or simultaneous processes to use while executing the command.
* *Show Changes*: Select to enable the display of Ansible changes in the
standard output. 
The default is OFF.
* *Enable Privilege Escalation*: If enabled, the playbook is run with administrator privileges. 
This is the equivalent of passing the `--become` option to the `ansible` command.

Enter variables using either JSON or YAML syntax. 
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
