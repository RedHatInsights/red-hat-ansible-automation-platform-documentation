= Adding tokens

Select menu:Tokens[] to display a list of the users that have tokens to access the application.

Configure authentication tokens for your users. 
You can select the application to which the token is associated and the level of access that the token has. 

[NOTE]
====
You can only create OAuth 2 Tokens for your user through the API or UI, which means you can only access your own user profile to configure or view your tokens. 
====

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access[Users].
. Select the user for which you want to configure the OAuth 2 tokens.
. Select the *Tokens* tab on the user's profile.
+
When no tokens are present, the *Tokens* screen prompts you to add them.
. Click btn:[Add] to open the *Create Token* window.
. Enter the following details:

* *Application*: enter the name of the application with which you want to associate your token. 
Alternatively, you can search for it by clicking the image:search.png[Search,15,15] icon. 
This opens a separate window that enables you to choose from the available options. 
Use the Search bar to filter by name if the list is extensive. 
Leave this field blank if you want to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) that is not linked to any application.
* Optional: *Description*: provide a short description for your token.
* *Scope* (required): specify the level of access you want this token to have.

. Click btn:[Save], or click btn:[Cancel] to abandon your changes.
+
After you save the token, the newly created token for the user is displayed with the token information and when it expires.
