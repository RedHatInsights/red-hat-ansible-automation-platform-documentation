= Using postinstall feature of containerized {PlatformNameShort}

[role="_abstract"]


Use the experimental postinstaller feature of containerized {PlatformNameShort} to define and load the configuration during the initial installation. This uses a configuration-as-code approach, where you simply define your configuration to be loaded as simple YAML files. 

. To use this optional feature, you need to uncomment the following vars in the inventory file:
+
----
controller_postinstall=true
----
+

. The default is false, so you need to enable this to activate the postinstaller. You need a {PlatformNameShort} license for this feature that must reside on the local filesystem so it can be automatically loaded:
+
----
controller_license_file=/full_path_to/manifest_file.zip
----
+

. You can pull your configuration-as-code from a Git based repository. To do this, set the following variables to dictate where you pull the content from and where to store it for upload to the {PlatformNameShort} controller:
+
----
controller_postinstall_repo_url=https://your_cac_scm_repo
controller_postinstall_dir=/full_path_to_where_you_want_the pulled_content_to_reside
----

Definition files use the link:https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/namespaces/infra/[infra certified collections]. The link:https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/validated/infra/controller_configuration/[controller_configuration] collection is preinstalled as part of the installation and uses the installation controller credentials you supply in the inventory file for access into the {PlatformNameShort} controller. You simply need to give the YAML configuration files. 

You can setup {PlatformNameShort} configuration attributes such as credentials, LDAP settings, users and teams, organizations, projects, inventories and hosts, job and workflow templates.

The following example shows a sample *your-config.yml* file defining and loading controller job templates. The example demonstrates a simple change to the preloaded demo example provided with an {PlatformNameShort} installation.
