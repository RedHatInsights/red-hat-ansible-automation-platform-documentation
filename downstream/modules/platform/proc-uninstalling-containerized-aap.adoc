[role="_abstract"]


To uninstall a containerized deployment, execute the *uninstall.yml* playbook.
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.uninstall
----

This will stop all systemd units and containers and then delete all resources used by the containerized installer such as:

* config and data directories/files
* systemd unit files
* podman containers and images
* RPM packages

To keep container images, you can set the *container_keep_images* variable to true.
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.uninstall -e container_keep_images=true
----
