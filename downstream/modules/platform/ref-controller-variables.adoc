= {ControllerNameStart} variables

[cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
|====
| *Variable* | *Description* 
| *`admin_password`* | The password for an administration user to access the UI upon install completion.
| *`automationcontroller_main_url`* | For an alternative front end URL needed for SSO configuration with {CatalogName}, provide the URL.

{CatalogNameStart} requires either Controller to be installed with {ControllerName}, or a URL to an active and routable Controller server must be provided with this variable
| *`automationcontroller_password`* | Password for your {ControllerName} instance.
| *`automationcontroller_username`* | Username for your {ControllerName} instance.
| *`nginx_tls_protocols`* | Defines support for `ssl_protocols` in Nginx.

Default = `TLSv1.2`.
| *`node_state`* | _Optional_

The status of a node or group of nodes. 
Valid options are `active`, `deprovision` to remove a node from a cluster or `iso_migrate` to migrate a legacy isolated node to an execution node.

Default = `active`.
| *`node_type`* | For `[automationcontroller]` group.

Two valid `node_types` can be assigned for this group.

A `node_type=control` implies that the node only runs project and inventory updates, but not regular jobs.

A `node_type=hybrid` has the ability to run everything.

Default for this group = `hybrid`.

For `[execution_nodes]` group

Two valid node_types can be assigned for this group.

A `node_type=hop` implies that the node forwards jobs to an execution node.

A `node_type=execution` implies that the node can run jobs.

Default for this group = `execution`.
| *`peers`* | _Optional_

Peer relationships define node-to-node connections. 

This variable is used to add `tcp-peer` entries in the `receptor.conf` file used for establishing network connections with other nodes. 
See link:https://receptor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connecting_nodes.html?highlight=tcp-peer[Peering]

The peers variable can be a comma-separated list of hosts and/or groups from the inventory.  
This is resolved into a set of hosts that is used to construct the `receptor.conf` file.

| *`pg_database`* | The name of the postgres database.

Default = `awx`.
| *`pg_host`* | The postgreSQL host, which can be an externally managed database.
| *`pg_password`* | The password for the postgreSQL database.

Do not use special characters for `pg_password`. 
They can cause the password to fail.

NOTE

You no longer have to provide a `pg_hashed_password` in your inventory file at the time of installation because PostgreSQL 13 can now store user passwords more securely. 

When you supply `pg_password` in the inventory file for the installer, PostgreSQL uses the SCRAM-SHA-256 hash to secure that password as part of the installation process.
| *`pg_port`* | The postgreSQL port to use.

Default = 5432
| *`pg_ssl_mode`* | One of `prefer` or `verify-full`.

Set to `verify-full` for client-side enforced SSL.

Default = `prefer`.
| *`pg_username`* | Your postgres database username.

Default = `awx`.
| *`postgres_ssl_cert`* | location of postgres ssl certificate.

`/path/to/pgsql_ssl.cert`
| *`postgres_ssl_key`* | location of postgres ssl key.

`/path/to/pgsql_ssl.key`
| *`postgres_use_cert`* | Location of postgres user certificate. 

`/path/to/pgsql.crt`
| *`postgres_use_key`* | Location of postgres user key. 

`/path/to/pgsql.key`
| *`postgres_use_ssl`* | If postgres is to use SSL.
| *`receptor_listener_port`* | Port to use for recptor connection.

Default = 27199.
| *`routable_hostname`* | `routable hostname` is used if the machine running the installer can only route to the target host through a specific URL,
for example, if you use shortnames in your inventory, but the node running the installer can only resolve that host using FQDN.

If `routable_hostname` is not set, it should default to `ansible_host`. Then if, and only if `ansible_host` is not set, `inventory_hostname` is used as a last resort.
| *`supervisor_start_retry_count`* | When specified (no default value exists), adds `startretries = <value specified>` to the supervisor config file (/etc/supervisord.d/tower.ini).

See link:http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#program-x-section-values[program:x Section Values] for further explanation about `startretries`.

| *`web_server_ssl_cert`* |  _Optional_ 

`/path/to/webserver.cert`

Same as `automationhub_ssl_cert` but for web server UI and API.
| *`web_server_ssl_key`* |  _Optional_

`/path/to/webserver.key`

Same as `automationhub_server_ssl_key` but for web server UI and API.
