= GitHub settings

To set up social authentication for GitHub, you must obtain an OAuth2 key and secret for a web application. 
To do this, you must first register the new application with GitHub at https://github.com/settings/developers. 

To register the application, you must supply it with your homepage URL, which is the *Callback URL* shown in the *Details* tab of the *GitHub default settings* page. 
The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.

.Procedure
. On the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[].
. On the *Settings* page, select *GitHub settings* from the list of Authentication options.
. Select the *GitHub Default* tab if not already selected.
+
The *GitHub OAuth2 Callback URL* field is already pre-populated and non-editable. 
When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret.

. Click btn:[Edit] and copy and paste the GitHub Client ID into the *GitHub OAuth2 Key* field.
. Copy and paste the GitHub Client Secret into the *GitHub OAuth2 Secret* field.
. For more information on completing the mapping fields, see xref:ref-controller-organization-mapping[Organization mapping] and xref:ref-controller-team-mapping[Team mapping].
. Click btn:[Save].

.Verification
To verify that the authentication was configured correctly, logout of {ControllerName}.  
The login screen now displays the GitHub logo to enable logging in with those credentials.
