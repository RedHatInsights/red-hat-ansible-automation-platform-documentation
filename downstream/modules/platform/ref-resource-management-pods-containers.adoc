= Resource management for pods and containers

When you specify a Pod, you can specify how much of each resource a container needs. 
The most common resources to specify are CPU and memory (RAM).

When you specify the resource request for containers in a Pod, the kubenetes-scheduler uses this information to allocate the node to place the Pod on. 
When you specify a resource limit for a container, the _kubelet_, or node agent, enforces those limits so that the running container is not permitted to use more of that resource than the limit you set. 
The kubelet also reserves at least the request amount of that system resource specifically for that container to use.
