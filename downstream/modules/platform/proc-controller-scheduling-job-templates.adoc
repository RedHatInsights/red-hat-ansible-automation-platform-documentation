.Procedure

* To schedule a job template, select the *Schedules* tab, and choose the appropriate method:
** If schedules are already set up, review, edit, enable or disable your schedule preferences.
** If schedules have not been set up, see ADD XREF:[Schedules] for more information.

If you select *Prompt on Launch* for the *Credentials field*, and you create or edit scheduling information for your job template, a *Prompt* option displays on the Schedules form. 

You cannot remove the default machine credential in the *Prompt* dialog without replacing it with another machine credential before you can save it. 

[NOTE]
====
To set `extra_vars` on schedules, you must select *Prompt on Launch* for *Variables* on the job template, or configure and enable a survey on the job template.

The answered survey questions then become `extra_vars`.
