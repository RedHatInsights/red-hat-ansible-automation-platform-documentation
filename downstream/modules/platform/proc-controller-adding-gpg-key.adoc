= Adding a GPG key to {ControllerName}

To use the GPG key for content singing and validation in {ControllerName}, add it by running the following command in the CLI:

[literal, options="nowrap" subs="+attributes"]
----
$ gpg --list-keys
$ gpg --export --armour <key fingerprint> > my_public_key.asc
----

[arabic]
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Credentials[].
. Click btn:[Add].
. Provide a meaningful name for the new credential, for example, "Infrastructure team public GPG key".
. In the *Credential Type* field, select *GPG Public Key*.
. Click *Browse* to locate and select the public key file, for example, `my_public_key.asc`.
. Click btn:[Save].

This credential can now be selected in `projects <ug_projects_add>`, and content verification automatically takes place on future project
synchronizations.

[NOTE]

====
Use the project cache SCM timeout to control how often you want {ControllerName} to re-validate the signed content. 
When a project is configured to update on launch (of any job template configured to use that project), you can enable the cache timeout setting, which sets it to update after `N` seconds have passed since the last update. 
If validation is running too frequently, you can slow down how often project updates occur by specifying the time in the *Cache Timeout*
field of the *Option Details* pane of the project.
