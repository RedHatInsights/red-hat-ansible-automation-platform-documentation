= About the installer inventory file

{PlatformName} works against a list of managed nodes or hosts in your infrastructure that are logically organized, using an inventory file. 
You can use the {PlatformName} installer inventory file to specify your installation scenario and describe host deployments to Ansible. 
Using an inventory file, Ansible can manage a large number of hosts with a single command. 
Inventories also help you use Ansible more efficiently by reducing the number of command-line options you have to specify. 

The inventory file can be in one of many formats, depending on the inventory plugins that you have. 
The most common formats are `INI` and `YAML``. 
Inventory files listed in this document are shown in INI format.

The location of the inventory file depends on the installer used. 
The following table shows possible locations: 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|====
| Installer | Location
| *Bundle tar* | `/ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-<latest-version>`
| *Non-bundle tar* | `/ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest-version>`
| *RPM* | `/opt/ansible-automation-platform/installer`
|====

You caan verify the hosts in your inventory using the command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
ansible all -i <path-to-inventory-file. --list-hosts
----

A typical inventory file might look something like this:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
[automationcontroller]
host1.example.com
host2.example.com
Host4.example.com

[automationhub]
Host3.example.com

[database]
Host5.example.com

[all:vars]
admin_password='<password>'

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password='<password>'

registry_url='registry.redhat.io'
registry_username='<registry username>'
registry_password='<registry password>'
----

The first part of the inventory file specifies the hosts or groups that Ansible can work with.
