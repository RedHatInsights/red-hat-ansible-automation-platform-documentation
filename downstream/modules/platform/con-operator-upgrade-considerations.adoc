[role="_abstract"]
{PlatformName} version 2.0 was the first release of the {OperatorPlatform}. If you are upgrading from version 2.0, continue to the xref::operator-upgrade_{context}[Upgrading the {OperatorPlatform}] procedure.

If you are using a version of {OCPShort} that is not supported by the version of {PlatformName} to which you are upgrading, you must upgrade your {OCPShort} cluster to a supported version prior to upgrading.

Use this support matrix to determine the {OCPShort} version needed:

.{PlatormNameShort}/{OCPShort} support matrix
[options="header"]
|====
|{PlatformNameShort}|Supported {OCPShort} versions
//|2.3 | 4.9 - 4.12 [Include row for the 2.3 release of doc]
|2.2 | 4.8 - 4.11
|2.1 | 4.7 - 4.10
|====

For information about upgrading your cluster, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.7/html-single/updating_clusters/index[Updating clusters].
