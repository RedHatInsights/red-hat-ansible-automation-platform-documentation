[role="_abstract"]
{PlatformName} version 2.0 was the first release of the {OperatorPlatform}. If you are upgrading from version 2.0, continue to the xref:upgrading-operator_operator-upgrade[Upgrading the {OperatorPlatform}] procedure.

If you are using a version of {OCPShort} that is not supported by the version of {PlatformName} to which you are upgrading, you must upgrade your {OCPShort} cluster to a supported version prior to upgrading.

Refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-automation-platform[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Life Cycle] to determine the {OCPShort} version needed.

For information about upgrading your cluster, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.7/html-single/updating_clusters/index[Updating clusters].
