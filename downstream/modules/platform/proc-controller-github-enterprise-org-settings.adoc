= GitHub Enterprise Organization settings

To set up social authentication for a GitHub Enterprise Organization, you must obtain a GitHub Enterprise Organization URL, an Organization API URL, an Organization OAuth2 key and secret for a web application. 

To obtain the URLs, refer to the GitHub documentation on link:https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/rest/reference/enterprise-admin[GitHub Enterprise administration]. 

To obtain the key and secret, you must first register your enterprise organization-owned application at `https://github.com/organizations/<yourorg>/settings/applications` 

To register the application, you must supply it with your Authorization callback URL, which is the *Callback URL* shown in the *Details* page. 

Because it is hosted on site and not `github.com`, you must specify which authentication adapter it communicates with.

Each key and secret must belong to a unique application and cannot be shared or reused between different authentication backends. 
The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[].
. On the *Settings* page, select *GitHub settings* from the list of Authentication options.
. Click the *GitHub Enterprise Organization* tab.
+
The *GitHub Enterprise Organization OAuth2 Callback URL* field is already pre-populated and non-editable. 
When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret.

. Click btn:[Edit] to configure GitHub Enterprise Organization settings.
. In the *GitHub Enterprise Organization URL* field, enter the hostname of the GitHub Enterprise Organization instance, for example, https://github.orgexample.com.
. In the *GitHub Enterprise Organization API URL* field, enter the API URL of the GitHub Enterprise Organiztion instance, for example, https://github.orgexample.com/api/v3
. Copy and paste GitHub's Client ID into the *GitHub Enterprise Organization OAuth2 Key* field.
. Copy and paste GitHub's Client Secret into the *GitHub Enterprise Organization OAuth2 Secret* field.
. Enter the name of your GitHub Enterprise organization, as used in your organization's URL, for example, https://github.com/<yourorg>/ in the *GitHub Enterprise Organization Name* field.
. For more information on completing the mapping fields, see xref:ref-controller-organization-mapping[Organization mapping] and xref:ref-controller-team-mapping[Team mapping].
. Click btn:[Save].

.Verification
To verify that the authentication was configured correctly, logout of {ControllerName}.
The login screen displays the GitHub Enterprise Organization logo to enable logging in with those credentials.
