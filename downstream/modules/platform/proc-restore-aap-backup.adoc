= Restore backup to new instance

Running the `./setup.sh` script with the `restore_backup_file` flag will migrate content from the backup file of your original 1.x instance to the new instance, effectively migrating all job histories, templates, and other {PlatformNameShort} related content.

.Procedure
. Run the following command:
+
----
$ ./setup.sh -r -e ‘restore_backup_file=/mybackup/tower-backup-latest.tar.gz’ -e ‘user_compression=True’ -e @credentials.yml -r -- --ask-vault-pass <1><2><3>
----
<1> `restore_backup_file` specifies the location of the {PlatformNameShort} backup database
<2> `use_compression` is set to `True` due to compression being used during the backup process
<3> `-r` sets the restore database option to `True`

. Log in to your new RHEL 8 Tower 3.8 instance and check if the content from your original instance content have been successfully restored:
.. Navigate to *Administration* > *Instance groups*. The recreated instance groups should now contain the *Total Jobs* from your original instance.
.. Using the side navigation panel, check that your content has been imported from your original instance, including Jobs, Templates, Inventories, Credentials, and Users.

You now have a new instance of Ansible Tower with all the Ansible content from your original instance.
