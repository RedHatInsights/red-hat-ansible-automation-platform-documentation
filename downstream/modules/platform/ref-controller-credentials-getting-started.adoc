The *Credentials* page displays a searchable list of all available Credentials and can be sorted by *Name*.

Credentials added to a Team are made available to all members of the Team, whereas credentials added to a User are only available to that specific User.

[NOTE]
====
If you delete items that are used by other work items, a message opens listing the items that are affected by the deletion and prompts you to confirm the deletion.

Some screens contain items that are invalid or previously deleted, and fail to run.
The following is an example of such a message:
