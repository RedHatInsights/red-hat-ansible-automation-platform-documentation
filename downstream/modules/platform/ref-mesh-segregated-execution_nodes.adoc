[id="mesh-segregated-execution"]

= Segregated local and remote execution configuration

[role="_abstract"]

This configuration adds a hop node and a remote execution node to the resilient configuration.
The remote execution node is reachable from the hop node.

You can use this setup if you are setting up execution nodes in a remote location, or if you need to run automation in a DMZ network.

The following image displays the topology of this mesh network.

image::mesh-segegrated-execution.png["The topology map of the configuration consists of an automation controller group, a local execution group, a hop node group, and a remote execution node group. The automation controller group consists of two control nodes: aap_c_1 and aap_c_2. The local execution nodes are aap_e_1 and aap_e_2. Every control node is peered to every local execution node. The hop node group contains one hop node, aap_h_1. It is peered to the controller group. The remote execution node group contains one execution node, aap_e_3. It is peered to the hop node group."]

The `[automationcontroller:vars]` stanza sets the node types for all nodes in the control plane and defines how the control nodes peer to the local execution nodes:

* All nodes in the control plane are automatically peered to one another.
* All nodes in the control plane are peered with all local execution nodes.

If the name of a group of nodes begins with `instance_group_`, the installer recognises it as an instance group and adds it to the {PlatformNameShort} user interface.
