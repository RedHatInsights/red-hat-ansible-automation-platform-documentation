= Finding and deleting PVCs

A persistant volume claim (PVC) is a storage volume used to store data that {HubName} and {ControllerName} applications use. These PVCs are independent from the applications and remain even when the application is deleted. If you are confident that you no longer need a PVC, or have backed it up elsewhere, you can manually delete them.

.Procedure

. List the existing PVCs in your deployment namespace:
+
-----
oc get pvc -n <namespace>
-----
+
. Identify the PVC associated with your previous deployment by comparing the old deployment name and the PVC name.
. Delete the old PVC:
+
-----
oc delete pvc -n <namespace> <pvc-name>
-----
+
