The following are necessary for you to work with project updates and collections:

* Ensure that the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_planning_guide/ref-network-ports-protocols_planning[network ports and protocols] listed in _Table 5.9. Automation Hub_ are available for successful connection and download of collections from {HubName} or {Galaxy} server.
* SSL inspection must be disabled either when using self signed certificates or for the Red Hat domains.

[NOTE]
====
The requirements for systems managed by {PlatformNameShort} are the same as for Ansible.
See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/index.html[Getting started with Ansible] in the Ansible _User Guide_.
====

.Additional notes for {PlatformName} requirements

* Although {PlatformName} depends on Ansible Playbooks and requires the installation of the latest stable version of Ansible before installing {ControllerName}, manual installations of Ansible are no longer required.

* For new installations, {ControllerName} installs the latest release package of Ansible 2.14.

* If performing a bundled {PlatformNameShort} installation, the installation program attempts to install Ansible (and its dependencies) from the bundle for you.

* If you choose to install Ansible on your own, the {PlatformNameShort} installation program detects that Ansible has been installed and does not attempt to reinstall it.

[NOTE]
====
You must install Ansible using a package manager such as `dnf`, and the latest stable version of the package manager must be installed for {PlatformName} to work properly.
Ansible version 2.14 is required for versions {PlatformVers} and later.
