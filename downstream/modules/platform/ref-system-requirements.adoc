.Additional notes for {PlatformName} requirements

* The requirements for systems managed by {PlatformNameShort} are the same as for Ansible. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html[Getting Started] in the Ansible _User Guide_.

* Although {PlatformName} depends on Ansible Playbooks and requires the installation of the latest stable version of Ansible before installing {ControllerName}, manual installations of Ansible are no longer required.

* For new installations, {ControllerName} installs the latest release package of Ansible 2.3.

* If performing a bundled {PlatformNameShort} installation, the installation program attempts to install Ansible (and its dependencies) from the bundle for you.

* If you choose to install Ansible on your own, the {PlatformNameShort} installation program detects that Ansible has been installed and does not attempt to reinstall it.

[NOTE]
====
You must install Ansible using a package manager such as `yum`, and the latest stable version of the package manager must be installed for {PlatformName} to work properly.
Ansible version 2.14 is required for versions {PlatformVers} and later.
