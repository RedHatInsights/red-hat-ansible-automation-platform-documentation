You can assign three types of users:

* *Normal User*: Normal Users have read and write access limited to the resources (such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.
* *System Auditor*: Auditors inherit the read-only capability for all objects within the environment.
* *System Administrator*: A System Administrator (also known as a Superuser) has full system administration privileges -- with full read and write privileges over the entire installation.
A System Administrator is typically responsible for managing all aspects of and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day work to various users.
