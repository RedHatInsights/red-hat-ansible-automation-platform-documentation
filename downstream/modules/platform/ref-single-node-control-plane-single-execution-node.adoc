= Single node control plane with single execution node

[role="_abstract"]
This example inventory file deploys a single-node control plane and establishes a peer relationship to an execution node.

[source,yaml]

[automationcontroller]
aap_c_1.example.com

[automationcontroller:vars]
node_type=control
peers=execution_nodes

[execution_nodes]
aap_e_1.example.com

The following image displays the topology of this mesh network.

image::mesh-single-control-node.png["The topology map shows an automation controller group and an execution node. The automation controller group contains a single control node: aap_c_1. The execution node is aap_e_1. The aap_c_1 node is peered to aap_e_1."]

The `[automationcontroller]` stanza defines the control nodes.
If you add a new node to the automationcontroller group, it will automatically peer with the `aap_c_1.example.com` node.

The `[automationcontroller:vars]` stanza sets the node type to `control` for all nodes in the control plane and defines how the nodes peer to the execution nodes:

* If you add a new node to the `execution_nodes` group, the control plane nodes automatically peer to it.
* If you add a new node to the `automationcontroller` group, the node type is set to `control`.

The `[execution_nodes]` stanza lists all the execution and hop nodes in the inventory.
The default node type is `execution`. You can specify the node type for an individual node:

[source,yaml]
-----
[execution_nodes]
aap_e_1.example.com node_type=execution
-----

Alternatively, you can set the node_type of all execution nodes in the `[execution_nodes]` group.
When you add new nodes to the group, they are automatically set to execution nodes.

[source,yaml]
-----
[execution_nodes]
aap_e_1.example.com

[execution_nodes:vars]
node_type=execution

-----

If you plan to add hop nodes to your inventory in future, it is better to define a separate group for the execution nodes, and set the `node_type` for the group:

[source,yaml]
-----
[execution_nodes]
aap_e_1.example.com

[local_execution_group]
aap_e_1.example.com

[local_execution_group:vars]
node_type=execution
