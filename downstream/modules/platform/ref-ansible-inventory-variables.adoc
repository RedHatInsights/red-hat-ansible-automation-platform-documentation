| *Variable* | *Description*
| *`ansible_connection`* | The connection plugin used for the task on the target host.

This can be the name of any of ansible connection plugin. 
SSH protocol types are `smart`, `ssh` or `paramiko`. 

Default = `smart`
| *`ansible_host`* | The ip or name of the target host to use instead of *`inventory_hostname`*.
| *`ansible_port`* | The connection port number, if not, the default (22 for ssh).
| *`ansible_user`* | The user name to use when connecting to the host.
| *`ansible_password`* | The password to use to authenticate to the host. 

Never store this variable in plain text. 

Always use a vault.
| *`ansible_ssh_private_key_file`* | Private key file used by ssh. 
Useful if using multiple keys and you do not want to use an SSH agent.
| *`ansible_ssh_common_args`* | This setting is always appended to the default command line for `sftp`, `scp`, and `ssh`. 
Useful to configure a ProxyCommand for a certain host (or group).
| *`ansible_sftp_extra_args`* | This setting is always appended to the default `sftp` command line.
| *`ansible_scp_extra_args`* | This setting is always appended to the default `scp` command line.
| *`ansible_ssh_extra_args`* | This setting is always appended to the default `ssh` command line.
| *`ansible_ssh_pipelining`* | Determines if SSH pipelining is used. 
This can override the pipelining setting in `ansible.cfg`.
If using SSH key-based authentication, then the key must be managed by an SSH agent.
| *`ansible_ssh_executable`* | (added in version 2.2)

This setting overrides the default behavior to use the system ssh. 
This can override the ssh_executable setting in `ansible.cfg`.
| *`ansible_shell_type`* | The shell type of the target system. 
You should not use this setting unless you have set the `ansible_shell_executable` to a non-Bourne (sh) compatible shell. 
By default commands are formatted using sh-style syntax. 
Setting this to `csh` or `fish` causes commands executed on target systems to follow the syntax of those shells instead.
| *`ansible_shell_executable`* | This sets the shell that the ansible controller uses on the target machine, and overrides the executable in `ansible.cfg` which defaults to `/bin/sh`. 

You should only change if it is not possible to use `/bin/sh`, that is, if `/bin/sh` is not installed on the target machine or cannot be run from sudo.
