= Single {ControllerName} with external (customer provided) database


[role="_abstract"]
Use this example to populate the inventory file to install {PlatformName}. This installation inventory file includes a single {ControllerName} node with an external database on a separate node that is not managed by the platform installer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This example does not have a host under the database group. This indicates to the installer that the database already exists, and is being managed elsewhere.
