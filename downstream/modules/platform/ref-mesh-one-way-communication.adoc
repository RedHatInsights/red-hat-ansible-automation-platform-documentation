= Outbound only connections to controller nodes

[role="_abstract"]

This example inventory file deploys a control plane consisting of two control nodes, and several execution nodes.
Only outbound connections are allowed to the controller nodes
All nodes in the 'execution_nodes' group are peered with all nodes in the controller plane.

The automation controller group consists of two control nodes: aap_c_1, and aap_c_2. The local execution nodes are aap-e-1, aap-e-2, aap-e-3, aap-e-4, and aap-e-5. Every execution node is peered to every control node in an outgoing connection."]
