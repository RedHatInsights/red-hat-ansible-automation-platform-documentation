= Example {PlatformName} multi-node inventory file


[role="_abstract"]
This example describes how you can populate the inventory file for a multi-node cluster installation of {ControllerName}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* You cannot install {ControllerName} and {HubName} on the same node.
* Provide a reachable IP address for the `[automationhub]` host to ensure users can sync content from Private Automation Hub from a different node.
* Do not use special characters for `pg_password`. It may cause the setup to fail.
* Enter your Red Hat Registry Service Account credentials in `registry_username` and `registry_password` to link to the Red Hat container registry.
