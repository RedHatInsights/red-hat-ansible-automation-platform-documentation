== Requests and limits

If the node where a Pod is running has sufficient resources available, it is possible for a container to use more resources than its request for that resource specifies. 
However, a container is not allowed to use more than its resource limit.

For example, if you set a memory request of 256 MiB for a container, and that container is in a Pod scheduled to a Node with 8GiB of memory and no other Pods, then the container can try to use more RAM.

If you set a memory limit of 4GiB for that container, the kubelet and container runtime enforce the limit. 
The runtime prevents the container from using more than the configured resource limit. 

For example, when a process in the container tries to consume more than the allowed amount of memory, the system kernel terminates the process that attempted the allocation, with an _Out Of Memory_ (OOM) error.

Limits can be implemented either reactively (the system intervenes once it sees a violation) or by enforcement (the system prevents the container from ever exceeding the limit). 

Different runtimes can have different ways to implement the same restrictions.

[NOTE]
====
If you specify a limit for a resource, but do not specify any request, and no admission-time mechanism has applied a default request for that resource, then Kubernetes copies the limit you specified and uses it as the requested value for the resource.
