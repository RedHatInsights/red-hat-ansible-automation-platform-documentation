= Jobs scheduled on the worker nodes

Both {ControllerName} and Kubernetes play a role in scheduling a job.  

When a job is launched, its dependencies are fulfilled, meaning any project updates or inventory updates are launched by {ControllerName} as required by the job template, project, and inventory settings.

If the job is not blocked by other business logic in {Controllername} and there is control capacity in the control plane to start the job, the job is submitted to the dispatcher. 
The default settings of the "cost" to control a job is 1 _capacity_. 
So, a control pod with 100 capacity is able to control up to 100 jobs at a time. 
Given control capacity, the job transitions from _pending_ to _waiting_. 

The dispatcher, which is a background process in the control plan pod, starts a worker process to run the job.
This communicates with the kubernetes API using a service account associated with the container group and uses the pod specification as defined on the Container Group in {ControllerName} to provision the pod. 
The job status in {ControllerName} is shown as _running_.

Kubernetes now schedules the pod. 
A pod can remain in the _pending_ state for `awx_container_group_pod_pending_timeout`. 
If the pod is denied through a `ResourceQuota`, the job starts over at _pending_. 
You can configure a resource quota on a namespace to limit how many resources may be consumed by pods in the namespace. 
For further information on ResourceQuotas, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/[Resource Quotas].
