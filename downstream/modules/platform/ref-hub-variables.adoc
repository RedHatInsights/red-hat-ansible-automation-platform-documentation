| *`automationhub_admin_password`* | Required
| *`automationhub_api_token`* a| If upgrading from {PlatformNameShort} 2.0 or earlier, you must either:

* provide an existing {HubNameMain} token as `automationhub_api_token`, or 

* set `generate_automationhub_token` to `true` to generate a new token

Generating a new token invalidates the existing token.
| *`automationhub_authentication_backend`* a| This variable is not set by default. 
Set it to `ldap` to use LDAP authentication. 

When this is set to `ldap`, you must also set the following variables:

* `automationhub_ldap_server_uri`

{HubNameMain} provides artifacts in `/var/lib/pulp`. 
{ControllerNameStart} automatically backs up the artifacts by default.

By default, both certified and validated content are uploaded. 

Possible values of this variable are 'certified' or 'validated'.

If you do not want to install content, set `automationhub_seed_collections` to `false` to disable the seeding.

If you only want one type of content, set `automationhub_seed_collections` to `true` and `automationhub_collection_seed_repository` to the type of content you do want to include.

| *`automationhub_ssl_validate_certs`* | For {PlatformName} 2.2 and later, this value is no longer used.

Value is `true` if {HubName} should validate certificate when requesting itself because by default, {PlatformNameShort} deploys with self-signed certificates.

Default = `false`.
| *`automationhub_upgrade`* | *Deprecated*

For Ansible Automation Platform 2.2.1 and later, the value of this has been fixed at true.

{HubNameStart} always updates with the latest packages.

Generating a new token will invalidate the existing token.

The default install deploys SSO with `sso_use_https=true`
| *`sso_redirect_host`* | If `sso_redirect_host` is set, it is used by the application to connect to SSO for authentication. 

This must be reachable from client machines.
