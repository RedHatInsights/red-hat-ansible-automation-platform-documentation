= Building a workflow

You can set up any combination of two or more of the following node types to build a workflow: 

* Template (Job Template or Workflow Job Template)
* Project Sync
* Inventory Sync
* Approval

Each node is represented by a rectangle while the relationships and their associated edge types are represented by a line (or link) that connects them.

.Procedure

. To launch the workflow visualizer, use one of these methods:
.. From the navigation panel, select menu:Resources[Templates]. 
... Select a workflow template, in the *Details* tab click btn:[Edit]. 
... Select the *Visualizer* tab.
.. From the *Templates* list view, click the image:visualizer.png[Visualizer,15,15] icon.
+

+
. Click btn:[Start] to display a list of nodes to add to your workflow.
+

+
. From the *Node Type* list, select the type of node that you want to add:
+

+
* If you select an *Approval* node, see xref:controller-approval-nodes[Approval nodes] for more information.
+
Selecting a node provides the available valid options associated with it.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you select a job template that does not have a default inventory when populating a workflow graph, the inventory of the parent workflow is used. 
Though a credential is not required in a job template, you cannot choose a job template for your workflow if it has a credential that requires a password, unless the credential is replaced by a prompted credential.
====
+
. When you select a node type, the workflow begins to build, and you must specify the type of action to be taken for the selected node. 
This action is also referred to as edge type.
. If the node is a root node, the edge type defaults to *Always* and is non-editable.
For subsequent nodes, you can select one of the following scenarios (edge type) to apply to each:
* *Always*: Continue to execute regardless of success or failure.
* *On Success*: After successful completion, execute the next template.
* *On Failure*: After failure, execute a different template.
. Select the behavior of the node if it is a convergent node from the *Convergence* field:
* *Any* is the default behavior, allowing any of the nodes to complete as specified, before triggering the next converging node. 
As long as the status of one parent meets one of those run conditions, an *any* child node will run. 
An *any* node requires all nodes to complete, but only one node must complete with the expected outcome.
* Choose *All* to ensure that all nodes complete as specified, before converging and triggering the next node. 
The purpose of *all** nodes is to make sure that every parent meets it's expected outcome in order to run the child node. 
The workflow checks to make sure every parent behaves as expected in order to run the child node. 
Otherwise, it will not run the child node.
+
If selected, the node is labelled as *ALL* in the graphical view:

+
[NOTE]
==== 
If a node is a root node, or a node that does not have any nodes converging into it, setting the Convergence rule does not apply, as its behavior is dictated by the action that triggers it.
====
+
. If a job template used in the workflow has *Prompt on Launch* selected for any of its parameters, a btn:[PROMPT] option appears, enabling you to change those values at the node level. 
Use the wizard to change the values in each of the tabs and click btn:[Confirm] in the *Preview* tab.
+

+
If a workflow template used in the workflow has *Prompt on Launch* selected for the inventory option, use the wizard to supply the inventory at the prompt. 
If the parent workflow has its own inventory, it overrides any inventory that is supplied here.
+

+
[NOTE]
====
For workflow job templates with required fields that prompt details, but do not have a default, you must provide those values when creating a node before the *Select* option is enabled.

The following two cases disable the btn:[SELECT] option until a value is provided by the btn:[PROMPT] option:

.. When you select the *Prompt on Launch* checkbox in a workflow job template, but do not provide a default.
.. When you create a survey question that is required but do not provide a default answer.

However, this is not the case with credentials. 
Credentials that require a password on launch are not permitted when creating a workflow node, because everything required to launch the node must be provided when the node is created. 
If you are prompted for credentials in a workflow job template, it is not possible to select a credential that requires a password in {ControllerName}.

You must also click btn:[SELECT] when the prompt wizard closes, to apply the changes at that node. 
Otherwise, any changes you make revert back to the values set in the job template.
====
+
When the node is created, it is labeled with its job type. 
A template that is associated with each workflow node runs based on the selected run scenario as it proceeds. 
Click the compass (image:compass.png[Compass, 15,15]) icon to display the legend for each run scenario and their job types.

+
. Hover over a node to add another node, view info about the node, edit the node details, edit an existing link, or delete the selected node:

+
. When you have added or edited a node, click btn:[SELECT] to save any modifications and render it on the graphical view.
For possible ways to build your workflow, see xref:controller-building-nodes-scenarios[Building nodes scenarios].
. When you have built your workflow job template, click btn:[Save] to save your entire workflow template and return to the new workflow job template details page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Clicking btn:[Close] does not save your work, but instead, it closes the entire Workflow Visualizer so that you have to start again.
