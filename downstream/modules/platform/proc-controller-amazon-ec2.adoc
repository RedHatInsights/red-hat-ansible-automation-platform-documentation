Use the following procedure to configure an AWS EC2-sourced inventory, 

.Procedure
. In the *Create new source* page, select menu:Source[].
. From the menu, select *Amazon EC2*.
. The *Create Source* window expands with additional fields. 
Enter the following details:

* Optional: *Credential*: Choose from an existing AWS credential (for more information, see xref:controller-credentials[Credentials]).
+
If {ControllerName} is running on an EC2 instance with an assigned IAM Role, the credential can be omitted, and the security credentials from
the instance metadata are used instead. 
For more information on using IAM Roles, see link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-%20roles-for-amazon-ec2.html[IAM_Roles_for_Amazon_EC2_documentation_at_Amazon].

. Optional: You can specify the verbosity, host filter, enabled variables or values, and update options as described in
xref:proc-controller-add-source[Adding a source].
. Use the *Source Variables* field to override variables used by the `aws_ec2` inventory plugin. 
Enter variables using either JSON or YAML syntax. 
Use the radio button to toggle between the two. 
For more information on these variables, see the
link:https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/amazon/aws/content/inventory/aws_ec2[aws inventory plugin documentation].

[NOTE]
====
If you only use `include_filters`, the AWS plugin always returns all the hosts. 
To use this correctly, the first condition on the `or` must be on `filters` and then build the rest of the `OR` conditions on a list of
`include_filters`.
