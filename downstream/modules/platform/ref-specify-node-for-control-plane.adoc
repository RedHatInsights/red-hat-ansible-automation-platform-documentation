= Specifying the node for control plane

A kubernetes cluster runs on top of multiple Virtual Machines or nodes (generally anywhere between 2 and 20 nodes). 
Pods can be scheduled on any of these nodes. 
The `topology_spread_constraints` setting enables you to configure how new pods are distributed across the underlying nodes when scheduled or created.  Typically your pods should not be scheduled on a single node, because if that node fails, so does the services those pods are providing.

Ansible also recommends that you specify that the control plane nodes be run on different nodes to the automation job pods. 
This is a good practice because if the control plane pods share nodes with the job pods, the control plane can become resource starved and degrade service of the whole application.
