= Upgrade planning

[role="_abstract"]
Before you begin the upgrade process, review the following considerations to plan and prepare your {PlatformNameShort} for the new version:

.Upgrading {ControllerName}

* Even if you already have a valid license from a previous version, you still must provide your credentials or a subscriptions manifest upon upgrading to the latest version of {ControllerName}. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/import_license.html[Import a subscription] in the Automation Controller User Guide.
* If you need to upgrade Red Hat Enterprise Linux and {ControllerName}, you will need to do a backup and restore of your {ControllerName} data. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/backup_restore.html#ag-backup-restore[Back up and restoring Controller] for details.
* Clustered upgrades require special attention to instance and instance groups prior to starting the upgrade. See link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/clustering.html#ag-clustering[Clustering] for details.

.Upgrading {HubName}
* When upgrading to AAP 2.1 or later, you have the option to add an existing {HubName} API token or generate a new one using the {PlatformNameShort} installer. See <<editing-inventory-file-for-updates_{context}, Setting up the inventory file >> for details.
