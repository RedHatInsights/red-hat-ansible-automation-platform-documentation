= Adding an instance

One way to expand capacity is to create an instance, to serve as a node in your topology.

.Procedure
. From the navigation panel, select menu:Instances[].
. In the *Instances* list view, click btn:[Add]. 
The *Create new Instance* window opens.

+
An instance requires the following attributes:
+
* *Host Name*: (required) Enter a fully qualified domain name (ping-able DNS) or IP address for your instance. 
This field is equivalent to `hostname` in the API.
* Optional: *Description*: Enter a description for the instance.
* *Instance State*: This field is auto-populated, indicating that it is being installed, and cannot be modified.
* *Listener Port*: This port is pre-populated with the most optimal port. 
However, you can change the port to one that is more appropriate for your configuration. 
This field is equivalent to `listener_port` in the API.
* *Instance Type*: This field is auto-populated and cannot be modified.
Only execution nodes can be created at this time.
* *Enable Instance*: Check this box to make it available for jobs to run on it
. When the attributes are configured, click btn:[Save].
+
The *Details* page of the created instance opens.

[NOTE]
====
The proceeding steps are intended to be run from any computer that has SSH access to the newly created instance. 
It should not be run from a machine that is part of the AAP deployment.

. Click the download image:download.png[Download,15,15] icon next to *Install Bundle* to download the tarball that includes this new instance and the files necessary to install the node into the {AutomationMesh}.

. Extract the downloaded `tar.gz` file from the location you downloaded it. 
The install bundle contains YAML files, certificates, and keys that are used in the installation process.
. Before running the `ansible-playbook` command, edit the following fields in the `inventory.yml` file:

* `ansible_user` with the username running the installation
* `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` to contain the filename of the private key used to connect to the instance

The content of the `inventory.yml` file serves as a template and contains variables for roles that are applied during the installation and configuration of a receptor node in a mesh topology. 
You can modify some of the other fields, or replace the file in its entirety for advanced scenarios. 
For more information, see link:https://github.com/ansible/receptor-collection/blob/main/README.md[Role Variables].

. Save the file to continue.
. Run the following command on the machine where you want to update your {AutomationMesh}:

ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml install_receptor.yml

. To view other instances within the same topology, select the menu:Peers[] tab associated with the control node.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can only view peers of the control plane nodes at this time, which are the execution nodes. 
Because you are limited to creating execution nodes in this release, you cannot create or view peers of execution nodes.

You can run a health check by selecting the node and clicking btn:[Run health check] on its *Details* page.
