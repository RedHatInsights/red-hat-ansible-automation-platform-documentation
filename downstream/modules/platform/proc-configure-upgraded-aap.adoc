== Configuring {ControllerName} instance groups

After upgrading your {PlatformName} instance, associate your original instance with its corresponding instance groups by configuring settings in the {ControllerName} UI:

. Log into the new Controller instance.
. Content from old instance, such as credentials, jobs, inventories should now be visible on your Controller instance.
. Navigate to menu:Administration[Instance Groups].
. Associate execution nodes by clicking on an instance group, then click the *Instances* tab.
. Click btn:[Associate]. Select the node(s) to associate to this instance group, then click btn:[Save].
. You can also modify the default instance to disassociate your new execution nodes.
