The image used at job launch time is determined by which execution environment is associated with the job. 
If a Container Registry credential is associated with the execution environment, then the controller uses `ImagePullSecret` to pull the image. 
If you prefer not to give the service account permission to manage secrets, you must pre-create the `ImagePullSecret`, specify it on the pod specification, and omit any credential from the execution environment used.
