= Single {HubName} with external (customer provided) database

[role="_abstract"]
Use this example to populate the inventory file to deploy a single instance of {HubName} with an external database that is not managed by the platform installer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This example does not have a host under the database group. This indicates to the installer that the database already exists, and is being managed elsewhere.
