[role="_abstract"]
Red Hat supports a number of installation scenarios for {PlatformNameShort}. Review the following examples and choose those suitable for your preferred installation scenario.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* For Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform or automation hub: Add an automation hub host in the [automationhub] group.
* You cannot install {ControllerName} and {HubName} on the same node.
* Provide a reachable IP address or fully qualified domain name (FDQN) for the [automationhub] host to ensure users can sync and install content from automation hub from a different node. Do not use 'localhost'.
* Do not use special characters for `pg_password`. It can cause the setup to fail.
* Enter your Red Hat Registry Service Account credentials in `registry_username` and `registry_password` to link to the Red Hat container registry.
