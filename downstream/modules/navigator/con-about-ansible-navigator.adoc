= Uses for {Navigator}

[role="_abstract"]

{Navigator} is a command line, content-creator-focused tool with a text-based user interface. You can use {Navigator} to:

* Launch and watch jobs and playbooks.
* Share stored, completed playbook and job run artifacts in JSON format.
* Browse and introspect {ExecEnvName}.
* Browse your file-based inventory.
* Render Ansible module documentation and extract examples you can use in your playbooks.
* View a detailed command output on the user interface.

//// 
comment outfor now:
{Navigator} makes the previous methods of inspecting and executing automation easy and frictionless since all that is required for {PlatformName} is to add {ControllerName} credentials into an {Navigator} configuration file. In this way, {Navigator} is a bridge between the worlds of the automation content creator who is used to working with the command line and the platform administrator, auditor or user who is more familiar with {PlatformName}.
