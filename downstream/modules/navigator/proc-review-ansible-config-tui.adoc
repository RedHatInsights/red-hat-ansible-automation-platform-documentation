= Reviewing your Ansible configuration from {Navigator}

[role="_abstract"]

You can review your Ansible configuration with the {Navigator} text-based user interface in interactive mode and delve into the settings. {Navigator} pulls in the results from an accessible Ansible configuration file, or returns the defaults if no configuration file is present.

.Prerequisites

* You have authenticated to the Red Hat registry if you need to access additional {ExecEnvName}. See https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication] for details.

.Procedure


. Start {Navigator}
+
----
$ ansible-navigator
----
+
Optional: type `ansible-navigator config` from the command line to access the Ansible configuration settings.

. Review the Ansible configuration.
+
----
 :config
----

+
Some values reflect settings from within the {ExecEnvName} needed for the {ExecEnvName} to function.  These display as non-default settings you cannot set in your Ansible configuration file.

. Type the number corresponding to the setting you want to delve into, or type `:<number>` for numbers greater than 9.

----
ANSIBLE COW ACCEPTLIST (current: ['bud-frogs', 'bunny', 'cheese']) (default:

 2│- bud-frogs
 3│- bunny
 4│- cheese
 5│default:
 6│- bud-frogs
 7│- bunny
 8│- cheese
 9│- daemon
----

The output shows the current `setting` as well as the `default`. Note the `source` in this example is `env` since the setting comes from the {ExecEnvName}.

.Verification

*  Review the configuration output.
