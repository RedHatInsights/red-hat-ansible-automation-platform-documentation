= {Navigator} modes

{Navigator} operates in two modes:

[role="_abstract"]

stdout mode:: Accepts most of the existing Ansible commands and extensions at the command line.
text-based user interface mode:: Provides an interactive, text-based interface to the Ansible commands for an enhanced set of capabilities that allow you to evaluate content, run playbooks, and troubleshoot playbooks after they run using artifact files.

== stdout mode

If you use the `-m stdout` subcommand, {Navigator} uses the familiar Ansible commands, such as `ansible-playbook` within {ExecEnvName}, or on your local development environment. This mode allows you to continue using commands you are familiar with for quick tasks.

{Navigator} also provides extensive help in this mode:

`--help`:: Accessible from `ansible-navigator` command or from any subcommand, such as `ansible-navigator config --help`.
subcommand help:: Accessible from the subcommand, for example `ansible-navigator config --help-config`. This subcommand specific help brings in the details of all the paramters supported from the related Ansible command, in this example, `ansible-config`.

== Text-based user interface mode

The text-based user interface mode provides enhanced interaction with {ExecEnvName}, collections, playbooks, and inventory. This mode is compatible with integrated development environments (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.

This mode includes a number of helpful user interface options:

colon commands:: You can access all the {Navigator} commands with a colon, such as `:run` or `:collections`
navigating the text-based interface:: The screen shows how to page up or down, scroll, escape to a prior screen or access `:help`.
output by line number:: You can access any line number in the displayed output by preceding it with a colon, for example `:12`.
color-coded output:: With colors enabled, {Navigator} displays items such as deprecated modules in red.
