= {Navigator} modes

{Navigator} operates in two modes:

[role="_abstract"]

stdout mode:: Accepts most of the existing Ansible commands and extensions at the command line.
text-based user interface mode:: Provides an interactive, text-based interface to the Ansible commands. Use this mode to evaluate content, run playbooks, and troubleshoot playbooks after they run using artifact files.

== stdout mode

Use the `-m stdout` subcommand with {Navigator} to use the familiar Ansible commands, such as `ansible-playbook` within {ExecEnvName} or on your local development environment. You can use commands you are familiar with for quick tasks.

{Navigator} also provides extensive help in this mode:

`--help`:: Accessible from `ansible-navigator` command or from any subcommand, such as `ansible-navigator config --help`.
subcommand help:: Accessible from the subcommand, for example `ansible-navigator config --help-config`. This help displays the details of all the parameters supported from the related Ansible command. 

== Text-based user interface mode

The text-based user interface mode provides enhanced interaction with {ExecEnvName}, collections, playbooks, and inventory. This mode is compatible with integrated development environments (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.

This mode includes a number of helpful user interface options:

colon commands:: You can access all the {Navigator} commands with a colon, such as `:run` or `:collections`
navigating the text-based interface:: The screen shows how to page up or down, scroll, escape to a prior screen or access `:help`.
output by line number:: You can access any line number in the displayed output by preceding it with a colon, for example `:12`.
color-coded output:: With colors enabled, {Navigator} displays items, such as deprecated modules, in red.
pagination and scrolling:: You can page up or down, scroll, or escape by using the options displayed at the bottom of each {Navigator} screen.

You cannot switch between modes after {Navigator} is running.

This document uses the text-based user interface mode for most procedures.
