Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: proc-doing-procedure-a.adoc
* ID: [id="doing-procedure-a_{context}"]
* Title: = Doing procedure A

The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

[role="_abstract"]
Use the acl_manager role to delete a security rule.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed Ansible 2.9 or later
* You have access to the firewall MGMT servers to enforce the new policies

.Procedure

. Install the acl_manager role using the ansible-galaxy command:
+
----
$ ansible-galaxy install ansible_security.acl_manager
----

. Using CLI, create a new playbook with the acl_manger role and set the parameters (e.g., source object, destination object, access rule between the two objects):
+
----
- name: delete block list entry
  hosts: checkpoint
  connection: httpapi

    - include_role:
        name: acl_manager
        Tasks_from: unblock_ip
      vars:
        source_ip: 192.168.0.10
        destination_ip: 192.168.0.11
        ansible_network_os: checkpoint
----

. Run the playbook $ ansible-navigator run --ee false <playbook.yml>:
+
