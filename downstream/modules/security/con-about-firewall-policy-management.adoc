Manage multiple firewall policies across various products and vendors with Ansible security automation.

An organization’s network firewall is the first line of defense against an attack and a vital component for maintaining a secure environment. As a security operator, you construct and manage secure networks to ensure that your firewall only allows inbound and outbound network traffic defined by your organization’s firewall policies. A firewall policy consists of security rules that protect the network against harmful incoming and outgoing traffic.

Managing multiple firewall rules across various products and vendors can be both challenging and time consuming for security teams.  Manual workflow processes that involve complex tasks can result in errors and ultimately cause delays in investigating an application’s suspicious behavior or stopping an ongoing attack on a server. When every solution in a security portfolio is automated through the same language, both security analysts and operators can perform a series of actions across various products in a fraction of the time. This automated process maximizes the overall efficiency of the security team.

Ansible security automation interacts with a wide variety of security technologies from a range of vendors. Ansible enables security teams to manage different products, interfaces, and workflows in a unified way to produce a successful deployment. For example, your security team can automate tasks such as blocking and unblocking IP and URLs on supported technologies such as enterprise firewalls.
