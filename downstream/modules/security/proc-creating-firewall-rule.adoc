Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: proc-doing-procedure-a.adoc
* ID: [id="doing-procedure-a_{context}"]
* Title: = Doing procedure A

The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

== Creating a new firewall rule

[role="_abstract"]
Use the acl_manager role to create a new firewall rule for blocking a source IP address from accessing a destination IP address.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed Ansible 2.9 or later
* You have access to the Check Point Management server to enforce the new policies

.Procedure

. Install the acl_manager role using the ansible-galaxy command.
+
----
$ ansible-galaxy install ansible_security.acl_manager
----

. Create a new playbook and set the following parameter. For example, source object, destination object, access rule between the two objects and the actual firewall you are managing, such as Check Point:
+
----
- name: block IP address
  hosts: checkpoint
  connection: httpapi

  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: acl_manager
        tasks_from: block_ip
      vars:
        source_ip: 172.17.13.98
        destination_ip: 192.168.0.10
        ansible_network_os: checkpoint
----

. Run the playbook ``$ ansible-navigator run --ee false <playbook.yml>``.
