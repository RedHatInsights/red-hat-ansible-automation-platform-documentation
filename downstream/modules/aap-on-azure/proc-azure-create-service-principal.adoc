= Creating a service principal

[role="_abstract"]
To allow the {PlatformNameShort} application to access and manage Azure resources, you must provide authorization credentials after deployment.
The Microsoft Azure collection supports service principal authentication.

To create a service principal, you must have administrator privileges with tenancy-wide permissions on your Azure tenant.
Your {AAPonAzureNameShort} deployment will be provisioned in the same Subscription ID as the service principal created in this step.

. Navigate to the Azure portal and click the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview[Cloud Shell] icon to open a bash Cloud Shell in your browser.
. Set the Azure CLI to use the subscription that you intend to use for automating Azure services. Run the following command from the shell:
+
-----
az account set --subscription <your_subscription_id>
-----
. Run the following command using the Azure CLI to create a privileged service principal in Azure AD:
+
-----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ansible --role Contributor
-----
+
The output displays the _appID_ and _tenant_ keys for the service principal:
+
-----
{
  "appId": "xxxxxxx-xxx-xxxx",
  "displayName": "ansible",
  "name": "xxxxxxx-xxx-xxxx",
  "password": "xxxxxxx-xxx-xxxx",
  "tenant": "xxxxxxx-xxx-xxxx"
}
-----
. Store the service principal details securely, as they are displayed only when you create the secret. You will need them when you deploy Automation controller.

== Maintaining your service principals

Service principal credentials have a limited lifetime that is set in your Azure AD configuration. Track the lifespan of the service principal if you intend to automate against Azure for an extended period of time. You can create a new one when needed.

To view records of updated or deleted service principles, run the following Azure CLI command:

-----
az ad sp list -o table | grep ansible
-----

This command does not display the secrets for your service principals. Delete the service principal and create a new one if the secret is lost.

When you create a new service principal to replace an expired or deleted one, you must update the credential that uses the service principal that you are replacing. If the credential is not updated, automations that use that credential will fail.
