= Access details

Regardless of the deployment type that is selected when {PlatformNameShort} is deployed, a set of DNS records are always created.
The DNS records are created so that {PlatformNameShort} can be issued a valid TLS certificate for your deployment and to enable easy access.

To view the URLs for the {PlatformNameShort} applications, navigate to the *Parameters and Outputs* page of the Azure Marketplace managed application listing for your deployment.
