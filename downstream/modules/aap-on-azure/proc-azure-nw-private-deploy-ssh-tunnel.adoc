= SSH tunnel

When VPN is not an option and your local users are more technical, the SSH tunnel approach is a secure alternative that enables users to access {PlatformNameShort} from a browser on a local machine.

To implement this access model, create a lightweight Linux-based SSH server in a DMZ network, similar to the Azure Hosted Virtual Machine method.
The SSH server does not require any workstation features, because it simply acts as a proxy between a userâ€™s local machine and {AAPonAzureNameShort}.

Each user must be configured as an SSH user on the server.
Users can then establish an SSH tunnel from the local machine to the SSH server to route traffic for {AAPonAzureNameShort}.

This approach is easier to implement on Linux and macOS host machines, but can be accomplished on Windows.

. Update your local hosts file so that the {PlatformNameShort} URLs route traffic to your local machine rather than the private IP that DNS records are configured with.
Add the following line to your hosts file:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
127.0.0.1 controller.<__your_AAPonAzure_instance__>.az.ansiblecloud.com
----
+
The following example shows the line in a hosts file:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting. Do not change this entry.
#
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

127.0.0.1 controller.<__your_AAPonAzure_instance__>.az.ansiblecloud.com

----
. As a user with root privileges, run the `ssh` command to establish an SSH tunnel.
+
In the example below, the IP address is the address of the SSH server in your DMZ.
Change this IP address for your SSH tunnel.
The `-L` flag makes your local system route traffic for the {ControllerName} URL over port 443 (HTTPs).
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
sudo ssh azureuser@20.231.60.123 -i ~/.ssh/id_ssh_key -N -f -L 443:controller.<__your_AAPonAzure_instance__>.az.ansiblecloud.com:443
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must use port 443 on both sides of the routing path. Using a different port on the local machine causes some {PlatformNameShort} features to not function properly.
====

When the SSH tunnel is established and your Azure routing is configured, you can access the {ControllerName} URL from your local browser at \https://controller.<__your_AAPonAzure_instance__>.az.ansiblecloud.com.
