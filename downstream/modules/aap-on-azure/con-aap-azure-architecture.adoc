= Application Architecture

{AAPonAzureName} is installed as a managed application.
Red Hat manages both the underlying Azure resources and the software running on it while that infrastructure runs in your Azure tenant.

The managed application  resource group is completely separate from other resource groups in your tenant.
Red Hat only has access to the managed application resource group, with no visibility into other tenant resources.

For information about how this works and how resources and access are isolated from the rest of your Azure resources, refer to link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/overview[Azure managed applications overview] in the Microsoft Azure documentation.

{AAPonAzureNameShort} uses two resource groups:

* A resource group in your tenant. This resource group includes a single resource referring to the {AAPonAzureNameShort} managed app deployment. 
Red Hat has access to this managed app to perform support, maintenance, and upgrades.
* A multi-tenant managed resource group that contains all the infrastructure needed to operate {AAPonAzureNameShort}. This multi-tenant resource group is shared between the Red Hat tenant and your tenant. Red Hat has full administrative control and you have read-only access to the resource group.

The following diagram outlines the application resources and architecture that are deployed into the managed application resource group when {AAPonAzureNameShort} is deployed into your Azure subscription.
