= {AAPonAzureNameShort} scaling

{AAPonAzureNameShort} allows autoscaling.

////
From architecture doc:
AKS should be configured to allow autoscaling with a customer selected machine-set configuration.
The current thought around pool autoscaling is to set an upper bound of 20 AKS worker VMs with scale down set to 1.

This is the current configuration; a min of 1 node and a max of 20. Will find the application profile that describes when nodes are created or destroyed.

There's some discussion of this in the slack channel.  But, in short, we basically use the MSFT autoscaler and its defaults currently.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-autoscaler#about-the-cluster-autoscaler

There will be some work to change this over time, but I would suggest that we link to this doc for now until we have differentiation in the scaling policy.
