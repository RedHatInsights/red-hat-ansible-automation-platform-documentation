You can configure the networking address range (CIDR block) for the VNET that your {AAPonAzureNameShort} application uses.
You set the CIDR block for the application in a network configuration form when you deploy {AAPonAzureNameShort}.
Plan your networking configuration before you deploy the {AAPonAzureNameShort} application, because you cannot change it after deployment.

When you are planning your network configuration, bear the following in mind:

* The managed application requires at least a /24 VNET that is divided into four subnets. The subnets have minimum address spacing.

|Networking entity |Minimum CIDR Block

|VNET |/24

|Cluster subnet |/26

|Gateway subnet |/28

|Database subnet |/28

|Private link subnet |/28
|===

* Ensure that the VNET range you configure does not intersect with the default CIDR block for AKS clusters (10.0.0.0/16).
The Azure user interface does not prevent you entering this range, but using the default AKS CIDR block for your VNET causes networking issues.
* To ensure successful network peering and communication between {AAPonAzureNameShort} and your existing networks, your enterprise network ranges must not overlap with the VNET network range.
* If you do not have any existing Azure VNETs, the Azure user interface suggests a default CIDR block and range for the VNET.
Do not accept these defaults. Instead, use the network configuration that you have planned.
