= Private deployment

A private deployment of {PlatformNameShort} resides in an isolated Azure VNet with no access from external sources: traffic to and from the public internet and other Azure VNets and subnets is blocked.

To access the URLs for the {PlatformNameShort} user interfaces, you must configure network peering.

Once peering and routing are configured, users can access {PlatformNameShort} through a VM on a connected Azure subnet, or directly if your organization has transit routing set up between Azure and your local network.


[NOTE]
====
No two Azure networking configurations are the same.
To allow user access to your {PlatformNameShort} URLs, your organization will need to work with your Azure administrators to connect the private access deployment.
