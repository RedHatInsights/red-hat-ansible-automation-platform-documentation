= About Ansible Roles

[role="_abstract"]

A role is Ansibleâ€™s way of bundling automation content as well as loading related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other artifacts automatically by utilizing a known file structure. Instead of creating huge playbooks with hundreds of tasks, you can use roles to break the tasks apart into smaller, more discrete and composable units of work.

You can find roles for provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do every day on Ansible Galaxy. Filter your search by *Type* and select *Role*. Once you find a role that you're interested in, you can download it by using the `ansible-galaxy` command that comes bundled with Ansible:

-----
$ ansible-galaxy role install username.rolename
