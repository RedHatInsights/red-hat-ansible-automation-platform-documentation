Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module.

A reference module provides data that users might want to look up, but do not need to remember. It has a very strict structure, often in the form of a list or a table.
A well-organized reference module enables users to scan it quickly to find the details they want.
AsciiDoc markup to consider for reference data:

.Unordered list
* For more details on writing reference modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles.
