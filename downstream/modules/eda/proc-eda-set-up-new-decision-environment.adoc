= Setting up a new decision environment

Decision environments are a container image to run Ansible rulebooks.
They create a common language for communicating automation dependencies, and provide a standard way to build and distribute the automation environment.
The default decision environment is found in the link:https://quay.io/repository/ansible/ansible-rulebook[Ansible-Rulebook]. 

To create your own decision environment refer to xref:eda-build-a-custom-decision-environment[Building a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible within Ansible Automation Platform].

The following steps describe how to import a decision environment into your {EDAcontroller} Dashboard.
