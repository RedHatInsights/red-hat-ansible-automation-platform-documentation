= Decision Frameworks

 {EDAName} includes, by default, an ansible.eda collection, which contains some sample sources, event filters and rulebooks. All the collections, ansible rulebooks and their dependencies use a Decision Environment, which is an image that can be run on either Podman or Kubernetes. 

In Decision Environments, sources are typically Python code that are distributed through ansible-collections. They inject external events into a rulebook for processing.It consists of the following:

* The python interpreter
* Java Runtime Environment
* ansible-rulebook python package
* ansible.eda collection

You can use the base Decision Environment and build your own customized Decision Environments with additional collections and collection dependencies. You can build a Decision Environment using a  Dockerfile or optionally you can deploy your CA certificate into the image.
