= Building a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible within Ansible Automation Platform

Refer to this section if you need a custom decision environment to provide a custom maintained or third-party event source plugin that is not available in the default decision environment.

== Environment

* Ansible Automation Platform > = 2.4
* Event-Driven Ansible
* Ansible Builder > = 3.0

== Procedure

* Add the `de-supported` decision environment. This image is built from a base image provided by Red Hat called `de-minimal`.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends using de-minimal as the base image with Ansible Builder to build your custom decision environments.
====

The following is an example of the Ansible builder definition file using de-minimal as a base image to build a custom decision environment with the ansible.eda collection:
-----
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-minimal-rhel8:latest'

dependencies:
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - ansible.eda
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: "python39"

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf
-----

Additionally, if other python packages or RPM are needed, you can add the following to a single definition file:
-----
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-minimal-rhel8:latest'

dependencies:
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - ansible.eda
  python:
    - six
    - psutil
  system:
    - iputils [platform:rpm]
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: "python39"

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf
