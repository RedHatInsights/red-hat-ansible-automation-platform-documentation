= Dependencies
To avoid issues with your {ExecEnvNameSing} image, make sure your definition file adheres to all Galaxy, Python and system dependency requirements.

== Galaxy
The `galaxy` entry points to a valid requirements file for the `ansible-galaxy collection install -r ...` command.

The entry `requirements.yml` may be a relative path from the directory of the {ExecEnvNameSing} definition’s folder, or an absolute path.

The content of a `requirements.yml` file may look like the following:

.A `requirements.yml` file for Galaxy
[example]
====
----
collections:
  - geerlingguy.java
  - kubernetes.core
----
====

== Python

The `python` entry in the definition file points to a valid requirements file for the `pip install -r ...` command.

The entry `requirements.txt` is a file that installs extra Python requirements on top of what the Collections already list as their Python dependencies. It may be listed as a relative path from the directory of the {ExecEnvNameSing} definition’s folder, or an absolute path. The contents of a `requirements.txt` file should be formatted like the following example, similar to the standard output from a `pip freeze` command:

.A `requirements.txt` file for Python
[example]
====
----
boto>=2.49.0
botocore>=1.12.249
pytz
python-dateutil>=2.7.0
awxkit
packaging
requests>=2.4.2
xmltodict
azure-cli-core==2.11.1
python_version >= '2.7'
collection community.vmware
google-auth
openshift>=0.6.2
requests-oauthlib
openstacksdk>=0.13
ovirt-engine-sdk-python>=4.4.10
----
====

== System

The `system` entry in the definition points to a https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/bindep/latest/readme.html[bindep] requirements file, which will install system-level dependencies that are outside of what the collections already include as their dependencies. It may be listed as a relative path from the directory of the {ExecEnvNameSing} definition’s folder, or an absolute path.

To demonstrate this, the following is an example `bindep.txt` file that adds the `libxml2` and `subversion` packages to a container:

.A `bindep.txt` file
[example]
====
----
libxml2-devel [platform:rpm]
subversion [platform:rpm]
