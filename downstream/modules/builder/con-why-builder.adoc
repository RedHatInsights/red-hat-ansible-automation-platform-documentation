= Why use {Builder}?

Before {Builder} was developed, Automation Platform users would potentially run against dependency issues and multiple error messages as they attempted to create a custom virtual environment or container that had all of their required dependencies installed.

Through the use of an easily customizable definition file, {Builder} installs Ansible, specified Collections and any of its dependencies so that all of the necessary requirements to get jobs running are fulfilled behind the scenes.

NOTE: If the end user chooses to provide their own container image when building execution environments, they will not be supported by Red Hat.
