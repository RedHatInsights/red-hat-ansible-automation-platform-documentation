= Why use {Builder}?

Before {Builder} was developed, {PlatformName} users could run into dependency issues and errors when  creating custom virtual environments or containers that included all of the required dependencies installed.

Now, with {Builder}, you can easily create a customizable {ExecEnvName} definition file that specifies the content you want included in your {ExecEnvName} such as, collections, requirements, and system level packages. This allows you fulfill all of the necessary requirements and dependencies to get jobs running.
