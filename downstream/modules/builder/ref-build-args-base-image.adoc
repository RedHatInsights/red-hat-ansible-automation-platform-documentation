= Build args and base image

The `build_arg_defaults` section of the definition file is a dictionary whose keys can provide default values for arguments to {Builder}. See the following table for a list of values that can be used in `build_arg_defaults`:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_CLI_COLLECTION_OPTS`
| Allows the user to pass arbitrary arguments to the ansible-galaxy CLI during the collection installation phase. For example, the â€“pre flag to enable the installation of pre-release collections, or -c  to disable verification of the server's SSL certificate.

| `EE_BASE_IMAGE`
| Specifies the parent image for the automation execution environment, enabling a new image to be built that is based off of an already-existing image. This is typically a supported execution environment base image like ee-minimal or ee-supported, but it can also be an execution environment image that you've created previously and want to customize further.

The default image is `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-23/ee-minimal-rhel8:latest`.

| `EE_BUILDER_IMAGE`
| Specifies the intermediate builder image used for Python dependency collection and compilation; must contain a matching Python version with `EE_BASE_IMAGE` and have ansible-builder installed.

The default image is `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-23/ansible-builder-rhel8:latest`.
|===

The values given inside `build_arg_defaults` will be hard-coded into the `Containerfile`, so these values will persist if `podman build` is called manually.

NOTE: If the same variable is specified in the CLI `--build-arg` flag, the CLI value will take higher precedence.
