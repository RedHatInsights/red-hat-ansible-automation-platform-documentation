= Build argument defaults

The `build_arg_defaults` section of the definition file is a dictionary whose keys can provide default values for arguments to {Builder}. See the following table for a list of values that can be used in `build_arg_defaults`:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Value | Description

| `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_CLI_COLLECTION_OPTS`
| Allows the user to pass arbitrary arguments to the ansible-galaxy CLI during the collection installation phase. For example, the –pre flag to enable the installation of pre-release collections, or -c  to disable verification of the server's SSL certificate.

| `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_CLI_ROLE_OPTS`
| allows the user to pass any flags, such as –no-deps, to the role installation.

|===

The values given inside `build_arg_defaults` will be hard-coded into the `Containerfile`, so these values will persist if `podman build` is called manually.

NOTE: If the same variable is specified in the CLI `--build-arg` flag, the CLI value will take higher precedence.
