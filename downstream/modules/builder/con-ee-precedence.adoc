= {ExecEnvNameStart} precedence

Project updates will always use the control plane {ExecEnvName} by default, however, jobs will use the first available {ExecEnvName} as follows:

. The `execution_environment` defined on the template (job template or inventory source) that created the job.
. The `default_environment` defined on the project that the job uses.
. The `default_environment` defined on the organization of the job.
. The `default_environment` defined on the organization of the inventory the job uses.
. The current `DEFAULT_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT` setting (configurable at `api/v2/settings/jobs/`)
. Any image from the `GLOBAL_JOB_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENTS` setting.
. Any other global execution environment.

[NOTE]
====
If more than one execution environment fits a criteria (applies for 6 and 7), the most recently created one is used.
