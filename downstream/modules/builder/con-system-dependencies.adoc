= System

The `system` entry in the definition points to a https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/bindep/latest/readme.html[bindep] requirements file, which will install system-level dependencies that are outside of what the collections already include as their dependencies. It can be listed as a relative path from the directory of the {ExecEnvNameSing} definitionâ€™s folder, or an absolute path. A minimum expectation is that the collection(s) specify necessary requirements for `[platform:rpm]`.

To demonstrate this, the following is an example `bindep.txt` file that adds the `libxml2` and `subversion` packages to a container:

.A `bindep.txt` file
[example]
====
----
libxml2-devel [platform:rpm]
subversion [platform:rpm]
----
====

Entries from multiple collections are combined into a single file. This is processed by `bindep` and then passed to `dnf`. Only requirements with no profiles or no runtime requirements will be installed to the image.
