= Ansible config file path
The `ansible_config` directive allows specifying the path to an `ansible.cfg` file to pass a token and other settings for a private account to an {HubName} server during the Collection installation stage of the build. The config file path should be relative to the definition file location, and will be copied to the generated container build context.

The `ansible.cfg` file should be formatted like the following example:

.An `ansible.cfg` file
====
----
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=my_ah_token
----
====

For more information on how to download a collection from {HubName}, please see the related Ansible documentation page.
