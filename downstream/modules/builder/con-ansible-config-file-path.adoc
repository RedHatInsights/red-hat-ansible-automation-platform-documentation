= Ansible config file path
When using an `ansible.cfg` file to pass a token and other settings for a private account to an {HubName} server, list the config file path (relative to where the definition file is located) as a string to enable it as a build argument in the initial phase of the build.

The `ansible.cfg` file should be formatted like the following example:

.An `ansible.cfg` file
====
----
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=my_ah_token
----
====

For more information on how to download a collection from {HubName}, please see the related Ansible documentation page.
