= Customizing an existing execution environment image

Ansible Controller ships with three default execution environments:

* `Ansible 2.9` - no collections are installed other than Controller modules
* `Minimal` - contains the latest Ansible 2.11 release along with Ansible Runner, but contains no collections or other additional content
* `EE Supported` - contains all Red Hat-supported content

While these environments cover many automation use cases, you can add additional items to customize these containers for your specific needs. The following procedure adds the `kubernetes.core` collection to the `ee-minimal` default image:

.Procedure
. Log in to `registry.redhat.io` via Podman:
+
----
$ podman login -u="[username]" -p="[token/hash]" registry.redhat.io
----
. Verify that you have access to pull the base image that you want to use.
.. For example, to pull a `ee-minimal` image, check that you have access to https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ansible-automation-platform-20-early-access/ee-minimal-rhel8/60e4bd0fdb72db7d0fadcf31[this repository].
. Configure your {Builder} files to specify any additional content to add to the new {ExecEnvShort} image which is based off of `ee-minimal`.
.. For example, to add the https://galaxy.ansible.com/kubernetes/core[Kubernetes Core Collection from Galaxy] to the image, fill out the `requirements.yml` file as such:
+
====
----
collections:
  - kubernetes.core
----
====
.. For more information on definition files and their content, refer to <<assembly-definition-file-breakdown,to definition file breakdown section>>.
. In the {ExecEnvShort} definition file, specify the filepath to the original `ee-minimal` container via the `EE_BASE_IMAGE` field. In doing so, your final `execution-environment.yml` file will look like the following:
+
.A customized `execution-environment.yml` file
[example]
====
----
version: 1

build_arg_defaults:
  EE_BASE_IMAGE: 'example.registry.com/my-base-ee'

dependencies:
  galaxy: requirements.yml
----
====
+
NOTE: Since this example uses the community version of `kubernetes.core` and not a certified collection from {HubName}, we do not need to create an `ansible.cfg` nor reference that in our definition file.
. Build the new {ExecEnvShort} image using the following command:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ ansible-builder build -t registry.redhat.io/_[username]_/_new-ee_
----
where `[username]` specifies your username, and `new-ee` specifies the name of your new container image.
.. Use the `podman images` command to confirm that your new container image is in that list:

----
====
. Verify your newly-created {ExecEnvShort} image via Ansible Navigator
. Push your image to the container registry in {HubName}:
+
----
$ podman push [automation-hub-IP-address]/_[username]_/_new-ee_
----
. Pull your new image into your {ControllerName} instance:
.. Navigate to {ControllerName}
.. From the side-navigational bar, click *Administration* > *Execution Environments*.
.. Click *Add*.
.. Enter the appropriate information then hit *Save* to pull in the new image.
+
NOTE: if your instance of {HubName} is password or token protected, ensure that you have the appropriate container registry credential set up.
