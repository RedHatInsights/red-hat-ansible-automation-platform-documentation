= Why use {ExecEnvName}?

{ExecEnvNameStart} help to ensure that automation runs consistently across multiple platforms and make it possible to incorporate system-level dependencies and collection-based content.

Execution environments give {PlatformName} administrators the ability to provide and manage automation environments to meet the needs of different teams.

They also enable automation teams to define, build, and update their automation environments themselves. 

{ExecEnvNameStart} provide a common language to communicate automation dependencies.

By providing a standard way to build and distribute the environment automation runs in, automation can also be scaled and shared between teams. 
Because they are defined and standardized, {ExecEnvName} provide a consistent {PlatformName} environment that is the same as production. And, {ExecEnvName} can be graduated to run in production.
