= Building a definition file

After you install {Builder}, you can create a definition file that {Builder} uses to create your {ExecEnvNameSing} image. {Builder} makes an {ExecEnvNameSing} image by reading and validating your definition file, then creating a `Containerfile`, and finally passing the `Containerfile` to Podman, which then packages and creates your {ExecEnvNameSing} image. The definition file that you create must be in `yaml` format and contain different sections. The default definition filename, if not provided, is `execution-environment.yml`. For more information on the parts of a definition file, see xref:assembly-definition-file-breakdown[Breakdown of definition file content].

The following is an example of a version 3 definition file. Each definition file must specify the major version number of the {Builder} feature set it uses. If not specified, {Builder} defaults to version 1, making most new features and definition keywords unavailable.
