= Python

The `python` entry in the definition file points to a valid requirements file for the `pip install -r ...` command.

The entry `requirements.txt` is a file that installs extra Python requirements on top of what the Collections already list as their Python dependencies. It may be listed as a relative path from the directory of the {ExecEnvNameSing} definitionâ€™s folder, or an absolute path. The contents of a `requirements.txt` file should be formatted like the following example, similar to the standard output from a `pip freeze` command:
