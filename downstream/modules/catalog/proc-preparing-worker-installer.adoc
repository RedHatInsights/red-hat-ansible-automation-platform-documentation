[role="_abstract"]
Installing the automation services catalog worker requires adding `host vars` in the {PlatformName} installer used for installation parameters.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the {PlatformNameShort} setup or setup bundle installer directory.
+
-----
# cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest>
-----
+
. Create a new directory called `host_vars`:
+
-----
# mkdir host_vars
-----
. Create a file for each required host. Examples with parameters for two hosts are included below.
.. Service account on `localhost`:
+
-----
# touch finance
-----
+
-----
ansible_connection: local

servicescatalog_controller_name: Finance

servicescatalog_controller_user: finance_sa
servicescatalog_controller_password: <password>
-----
+
.. Service account on an additional host:
+
-----
# touch marketing
-----
+
-----
ansible_host: IP address
ansible_user: [User should have sudo access to install packages and write to system-level configuration files]
ansible_become: true

servicescatalog_controller_name: Marketing

servicescatalog_controller_user: marketing_sa
servicescatalog_controller_password: password
-----
+
. Save each file.
. Open the `inventory` file in the {PlatformNameShort} installer:
+
-----
# vi inventory
-----
+
. Add the `host_vars` for each host under `[servicescatalog_workers]`:
+
----
[servicescatalog_workers]
finance
marketing
----
+
. Save the inventory file.

= Running the installer

You can now proceed to run the installer.

* Run the {PlatformNameShort} setup script:
+
-----
# ./setup.sh
-----

Running the automation services catalog worker will create an application and an application token, install the necessary packages, connect to cloud.redhat.com, and start the service.
