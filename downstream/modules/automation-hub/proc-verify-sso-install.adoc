= Verifying {RHSSO} connection

The installer uses the {RHSSO} variables to setup a Keycloak realm and client.

To verify that you have successfully connected to the existing {RHSSO} installation, check that `settings.py` contains the {RHSSO} host information, the realm name, the key, and the secret.
