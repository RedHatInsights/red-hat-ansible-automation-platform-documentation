= About Red Hat Certified collections synclists

A synclist is a curated group of Red Hat Certified collections that is assembled by your Organization Administrator that syncs to your local Automation Hub. Use synclists to manage only the content that you want and exclude unnecessary collections. You can design and manage your synclist from the content available as part of Red Hat Certified collections on cloud.redhat.com

Each synclist has its own unique repository URL you can use to designate as a remote source for content in Automation Hub and is securely accessed using an API token.
