= About Red Hat {CertifiedName} synclists

A synclist is a curated group of Red Hat Certified collections that is assembled by your organization administrator that synchronizes with your local {HubNameMain}. 
You can use synclists to manage only the content that you want and exclude unnecessary collections.
You can design and manage your synclist from the content available as part of Red Hat content on {Console}

Each synclist has its own unique repository URL that you can use to designate as a remote source for content in {HubName} and is securely accessed using an API token.
