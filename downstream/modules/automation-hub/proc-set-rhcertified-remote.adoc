= Configuring the rh-certified remote repository and syncing Red Hat Certified collections.

You can edit the *rh-certified* remote repository to sync collections from {HubName} hosted on cloud.redhat.com to your local {HubName}.
By default, your local {HubName} `rh-certified` repository includes the URL for the entire group of Red Hat Certified Collections available on cloud.redhat.com.
To use only those collections specified by your organization, you must include a unique URL.

.Prerequisites

* You have *Modify Ansible repo content* permissions.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/managing_user_access_in_private_automation_hub/index[Managing user access in Automation Hub] for more information on permissions.
* You have retrieved the Sync URL and API Token from the {HubName} hosted service on cloud.redhat.com.

.Procedure

. In the *rh-certified* remote, click image:more_actions.png[More actions] and click btn:[Edit].
. In the modal, paste the Sync URL and Token you acquired from cloud.redhat.com.
. Click btn:[Save].

The modal closes and returns you to the *Repo Management* page.
You can now sync collections between your organization synclist on cloud.redhat.com and your local {HubName}.

. Click btn:[Sync] to sync collections.

The *Sync status* notification updates to notify you of completion of Red Hat Certified collections sync.
