= Configuring the rh-certified remote repository and syncing {CertifiedColl}.

You can edit the *rh-certified* remote repository to synchronize collections from {HubName} hosted on {Console} to your {PrivateHubName}.
By default, your {PrivateHubName} `rh-certified` repository includes the URL for the entire group of {CertifiedName}.
To only use those collections specified by your organization, you must include a unique URL.

.Prerequisites

* You have valid *Modify Ansible repo content* permissions.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/managing_user_access_in_private_automation_hub/index[Managing user access in Automation Hub] for more information on permissions.
* You have retrieved the Sync URL and API Token from the {HubName} hosted service on {Console}.

.Procedure

. Log in to your {PrivateHubName}.
. Navigate to menu:Repo Management[].
. Click the *Remotes* tab.
. In the *rh-certified* remote repository, click image:ellipsis.png[More,5,12] and click btn:[Edit].
. In the modal, paste the *Sync URL* and Token you acquired from {Console}.
. Click btn:[Save].
+
The modal closes and returns you to the *Repo Management* page.
You can now synchronize collections between your organization synclist on {Console} and your {PrivateHubName}.
+
. Click btn:[Sync] to sync collections.

The *Sync status* notification updates to notify you of completion of the Red Hat Certified Content Collections synchronization.

.Verification

Select *Red Hat Certified* from the collections content drop-down list to confirm that your collections content has synchronized successfully.
