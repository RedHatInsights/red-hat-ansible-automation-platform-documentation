= About remote repositories

By cconfiguring remote repositories, you can set your {PrivateHubName} to synchronise Red Hat Certified Collections hosted in your organization's repository on `{Console}` and your choice of collections in {Galaxy}.

Each remote repository located in menu:Repo Management[Remote] provides information for both the *community* and *rh-certified* repository about when the repo was *last updated* and when content was *last synced*. 
You can add new content to {HubName} at any time using the *Edit* and *Sync* features included on the menu:Repo Management[Remote] page.
