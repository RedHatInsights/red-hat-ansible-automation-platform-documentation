= Reasons to create remote configurations

With remote configurations, you can set your {PrivateHubName} to synchronize Red Hat Certified Collections hosted in your organization's repository on `{Console}` and your choice of collections in {Galaxy}.

Each remote configuration located in menu:Automation Hub[Remotes] provides information for both the *community* and *rh-certified* repository about when the repository was *last updated*.
You can add new content to {HubNameMain} at any time using the *Edit* and *Sync* features included on the menu:Automation Hub[Repositories] page.
