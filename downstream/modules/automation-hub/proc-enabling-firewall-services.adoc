= Enabling firewall services

Because of the requirement of using a shared filesystem as part of a highly available {HubNameMain} environment, the following firewall services must be enabled to ensure that the filesystem is successfully mounted.

On each {HubNameMain} node, you must:

. Ensure the following `firewalld` services (`nfs`, `mountd`, `rpc-bind`) are enabled.

. Reload `firewalld` for changes to take effect.

# firewall-cmd --reload
