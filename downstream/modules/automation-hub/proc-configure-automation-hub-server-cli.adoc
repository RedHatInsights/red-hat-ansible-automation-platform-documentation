= Configuring Red Hat {HubName} as the primary source for content

Configure Red Hat automation hub as your primary source of content to access Ansible Certified Content Collections. You can configure automation hub in the command-line interface (CLI) or the web console.

== Configuring Red Hat automation hub as the primary source for content using the CLI

Configure Red Hat automation hub as your primary source of content by using the CLI. To configure automation hub, you must modify the `ansible.cfg` configuration file. With automation hub, you have access to certified, supported collections.

.Prerequisites

* You have obtained the API token for the {HubName} server. See xref:proc-create-api-token[Creating the Red Hat {HubName} API token] for more information.
[IMPORTANT]
====
	Creating a new token revokes any previous tokens 
	generated for Private Automation Hub. Ensure that you update any Controller or scripts that you created with the previous token.
====

.Procedure

. Add the `server_list` option under the `[galaxy]` section and provide one or more server names.
. Create a new section for each server name:
+
-----
[galaxy_server._<server_name>_]
-----

. Set the `url` option for each server name. You must include the `api/galaxy/` subdirectory in the server URL:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
-----
https://__<server_fully_qualified_domain_name>__/api/galaxy/
-----
. Optional: Set the `auth_url` option. The community Ansible Galaxy does not require an `auth_url`.
. Set the API token for the {HubName} server.

The following `ansible.cfg` configuration file example shows how to configure multiple servers in prioritized order, with {HubName} configured as your primary source and an Ansible Galaxy server as a secondary source:

.ansible.cfg
-----
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub, my_org_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/api/galaxy/ <1> <2>
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token

token=my_ah_token

[galaxy_server.my_org_hub]
url=https://automation.my_org/api/galaxy/ <3>
username=my_user
password=my_pass
-----
<1> Include a trailing slash */* after the server URL.
<2> Include the `/api/galaxy/` subdirectory in the Ansible Galaxy server URL.
<3> Include the `/api/galaxy/` subdirectory in the {HubName} server URL.

NOTE: All API URLs must end with a trailing slash */* in order to prevent receiving a 301 redirect.

You have now configured automation hub as your primary server using CLI, and can proceed to download and install supported collections.
