= Deleting a namespace

You can delete unwanted namespaces to manage storage on your {hubname} server. To do so, ensure that the namespace does not contain a collection with dependencies.

.Prerequisites
* The namespace being deleted does not have a collection with dependencies.
* You have *Delete namespace* permissions.

.Procedure
. Log in to your local {hubname}.
. Navigate to menu:Collections[Namespaces].
. Click the namespace to be deleted.
. Click image:images/more_actions.png[], then click btn:[Delete namespace].
+
NOTE: If the btn:[Delete namespace] button is disabled, it means that this namespace contains a collection with dependencies. Review the collections in this namespace and delete any dependencies to proceed with the namespace deletion. See _Managing collections on automation hub_ in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform documentation] for information about deleting collections.

The deleted namespace, as well as its associated collections, will now be deleted and removed from the namespace list view.
