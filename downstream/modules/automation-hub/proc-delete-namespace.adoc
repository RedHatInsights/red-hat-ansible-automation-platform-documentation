= Deleting a namespace

You can delete unwanted namespaces to manage storage on your {HubName} server. To do so, ensure that the namespace does not contain a collection with dependencies.

.Prerequisites
* The namespace you are deleting does not have a collection with dependencies.
* You have *Delete namespace* permissions.

.Procedure
. Log in to your local {HubName}.
. Navigate to menu:Collections[Namespaces].
. Click the namespace to be deleted.
. Click the btn:[More Actions] icon *{MoreActionsIcon}*, then click btn:[Delete namespace].
+
NOTE: If the btn:[Delete namespace] button is disabled, it means that this namespace contains a collection with dependencies. Review the collections in this namespace and delete any dependencies to proceed with the namespace deletion. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.3/html-single/uploading_content_to_red_hat_automation_hub/index#delete-collection[Deleting a collection on automation hub] for information about deleting collections.

The namespace that you deleted, as well as its associated collections, is now deleted and removed from the namespace list view.
