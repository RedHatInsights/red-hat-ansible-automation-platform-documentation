= Creating a namespaces

You can create a namespace to use to group collections your developers upload to Automation Hub. When creating a namespace, you can assign a group in Automation Hub as owners of that namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have *Add Namespaces* and *Upload to Namespaces* permissions.

.Procedure
. Log in to your local Automation Hub.
. Navigate to *My Namespaces*.
. Click *Create* and provide a *namespace name* and assign a group of *Namespace owners*.
. Click *Create*.

Your content developers can now proceed to upload collections to your new namespace, or allow users in groups assigned as owners to upload collections.
