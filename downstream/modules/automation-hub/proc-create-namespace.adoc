= Creating a namespace

You can create a namespace to organize collections that your content developers upload to {HubName}. When creating a namespace, you can assign a group in {HubName} as owners of that namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have *Add Namespaces* and *Upload to Namespaces* permissions.

.Procedure
. Log in to your local {HubName}.
. Navigate to menu:Automation Hub[Namespaces].
. Click btn:[Create] and provide a *namespace name* and assign a group of *Namespace owners*.
. Click btn:[Create].

Your content developers can now proceed to upload collections to your new namespace, or allow users in groups assigned as owners to upload collections.
