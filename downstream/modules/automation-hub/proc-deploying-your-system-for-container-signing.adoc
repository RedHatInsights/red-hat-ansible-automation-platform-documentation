= Deploying your system for container signing

Execution Environments are container images used by Ansible Automation Controller to run jobs. This content can be downloaded to the private automation hub, and published within your organization.

Automation hub is now implementing image signing so the user can rely on better security for the EE container images.

As an Ansible Automation Platform user, you can now confirm if an EE/Container is already signed, or how to use the proper tools to sign and verify the signature yourself. This section details how to deploy your system so it is ready for container signing.


.Procedure
. Deploy your system with support for container signing activated.

    _automation_hub:
        automationhub_create_default_container_signing_service: true
        automationhub_container_signing_service_key: _path/to/gpg.key_
        automationhub_container_signing_service_script: _path/to/executable_


. Navigate to automation hub.

. In the navigation pane, select menu:Signature Keys[].

. Ensure you have a key titled *container-default*, or *container*-_anyname_.

NOTE: The 'container-default' service is created by the AAP installer.
