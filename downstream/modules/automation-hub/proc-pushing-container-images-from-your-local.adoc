= Pushing container images from your local

.Procedure
. From a terminal, log into podman, or any container client currently in use.
+
----
> podman pull <__container-name__>
----
+
. After the image is pulled, add tags:
+
----
> podman tag <container-name> _<server-address>_/<container-name>:<tag name>
----
+
. Sign the image after changes have been made, and push it back up:
+
----
> podman push _<server-address>_/<container-name>:<tag name>
--tls-verify=false --sign-by<reference to the gpg key on your local>
----
+
If the image is not signed, it can only be pushed with any current signature
embedded.

. Push the image without signing it:
+
----
> podman push _<server-address>_/<container-name>:<tag name>
--tls-verify=false
----
+

environment.

image has been signed. In this case, it displays "Unsigned."
