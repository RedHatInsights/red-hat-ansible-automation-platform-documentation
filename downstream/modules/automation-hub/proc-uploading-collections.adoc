= Uploading collections to your namespaces

You can upload internally developed collections to your local {HubName} namespace for review and approval by an {HubName} administrator. When approved, the collection moves to the *Published* content repository where {HubName} users can view and download it.

[NOTE]
====
Format your collection file name as follows: <NAMESPACE-COLLECTION-NAME.tar.gz>
====

.Prerequisites
* You have a namespace to which you can upload the collection.

. Navigate to menu:Automation Hub[Namespaces] and select a namespace.
. Click btn:[Upload collection].
. Click btn:[Select file] from the *New collection* modal.
. Select the collection to upload.
. Click btn:[Upload].

The *My Imports* screen provides a summary of tests and notifies you if the collection uploaded successfully or failed.
