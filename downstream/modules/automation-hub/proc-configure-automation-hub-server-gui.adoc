= Configuring Red Hat {HubName} as the primary source for content using the web console

Configure Red Hat automation hub as your primary source of content by using the web console. To configure automation hub, you must create a credential and add it to the Organization’s Galaxy Credentials field. With automation hub, you have access to certified, supported collections.

.Prerequisites

* You have obtained the API token for the {HubName} server. See link: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/1.2/html/getting_started_with_red_hat_ansible_automation_hub/proc-create-api-token[Creating the {HubName} API token] for more information.
[IMPORTANT]
====
	Creating a new token revokes any previous tokens 
	generated for Private Automation Hub. Ensure that you update any Controller or scripts that you created with the previous token.
