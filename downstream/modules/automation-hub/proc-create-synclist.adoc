= Creating a synclist of Red Hat {CertifiedName}

You can create a synclist of curated {CertifiedCon} in {HubNameMain} on {Console}.
Your synclist repository is located under menu:Automation Hub[Repo Management], which is updated whenever you choose to manage content within {CertifiedName}.

All {CertifiedName} are included by default in your initial organization synclist.

.Prerequisites

* You have a valid {PlatformNameShort} subscription.
* You have Organization Administrator permissions for {Console}.
* The following domain names are part of either the firewall or the proxy's allowlist for successful connection and download of collections from {HubName} or Galaxy server:
** `galaxy.ansible.com`
** `cloud.redhat.com`
** `{Console}`
** `sso.redhat.com`
* {HubNameMain} resources are stored in Amazon Simple Storage and the following domain name is in the allow list:
** `automation-hub-prd.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`
** `ansible-galaxy.s3.amazonaws.com`
* SSL inspection is disabled either when using self signed certificates or for the Red Hat domains.

.Procedure

. Log in to `{Console}`.
. Navigate to menu:Automation Hub[Collections].
. Use the toggle switch on each collection to determine whether to exclude it from your synclist.
. When you finish managing collections for your synclist, navigate to menu:Automation Hub[Repositories] to initiate the remote repository synchronization to your {PrivateHubName}.
. Optional: If your remote repository is already configured, you can manually synchronize Red Hat {CertifiedName} to your {PrivateHubName} to update the collections content that you made available to local users.
