= Configuring Ansible-Galaxy CLI to verify collections

You can configure Ansible-Galaxy CLI to verify collections. This assures that collections you download are approved by your organization and have not been changed after it was uploaded to {HubName}.

If a collection has been signed by the Galaxy server, the server provides ASCII armored, GPG-detached signatures to verify the authenticity of the MANIFEST.json before using it to verify the collection’s contents. You must opt into signature verification by link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/config.html#galaxy-gpg-keyring[configuring a keyring] for `ansible-galaxy` or providing the path with the `--keyring` option.

.Prerequisites

* Signed collections are available in {HubName} to verify signature.
* Certified collections can be signed by approved roles within your organization.
* Public key for verification has been added to the local system keyring.

.Procedure

. To import a public key into a non-default keyring for use with `ansible-galaxy`, run the following command.
+
----
gpg --import --no-default-keyring --keyring ~/.ansible/pubring.kbx my-public-key.asc
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In addition to any signatures provided by the Galaxy server, signature sources can also be provided in the requirements file and on the command line. Signature sources should be URIs.
====
+
. Use the `--signature` option to verify the collection name provided on the CLI with an additional signature.
+
----
ansible-galaxy collection install namespace.collection
--signature https://examplehost.com/detached_signature.asc
--signature file:///path/to/local/detached_signature.asc --keyring ~/.ansible/pubring.kbx
----
You can use this option multiple times to provide multiple signatures.
. Confirm that the collections in a requirements file lists any additional signature sources following the collection’s signatures key, as in the following example.
+
[source,yaml]
----
# requirements.yml
collections:
  - name: ns.coll
    version: 1.0.0
    signatures:
      - https://examplehost.com/detached_signature.asc
      - file:///path/to/local/detached_signature.asc

ansible-galaxy collection verify -r requirements.yml --keyring ~/.ansible/pubring.kbx
----
+
When you install a collection from a Galaxy server, the signatures provided by the server are saved along with the installed collections to verify the collection’s authenticity.
. (Optional) If you need to verify the internal consistency of your collection again without querying the Galaxy server, run the same command you used previously using the `--offline` option.
