= Setting up the shared filesystem

On each automation hub node, you must:

. Create the `/var/lib/pulp` directory.
+
----
# mkdir /var/lib/pulp
----
+
. Mount the shared filesystem (this reference environment uses an NFS share).
+
----
# mount -t nfs4 <nfs_share_ip_address>:/ /var/lib/pulp
----
+
. Confirm that the shared filesystem is successfully mounted:
+
----
$ df -h
----
