== Assigning roles to groups

You can assign roles to groups, giving users access to specific features in the system, from both the *Groups* menu and the *Namespaces* menu. Roles assigned to a group from the *Groups* menu have a global scope. For example, if a user is assigned a namespace owner role, that permission applies to all namespaces. However, roles assigned to a group from the _Namespaces_ menu will only give a user access to a specific instance of an object.

.Prerequisites

You are signed in as a `hubadmin` user.

.Procedure

Assigning roles from the *Groups* menu.

. Log in to your local {HubName}.
. Navigate to the *User Access* drop-down menu.
. Click btn:[Groups] and select a group name.
. Click btn:[Add roles].
. Click the checkbox next to the role that you want to add.
. Click btn:[Next] to preview the role that will be applied to the group.
. Click btn:[Add] to apply the selected role to the group.

[NOTE]
Click btn:[Back] to return to the roles menu, or click btn:[Cancel] to return to the previous page.

.Procedure

Assigning roles from the *Namespaces* menu.

. Log in to your local {HubName}.
. Navigate to the *Collections* drop-down menu.
. Click the *My Namespaces* tab, and select a namespace.
. Click the *Namespace owners* tab to edit.

Users can now access features in {HubName} associated with their assigned permissions.
