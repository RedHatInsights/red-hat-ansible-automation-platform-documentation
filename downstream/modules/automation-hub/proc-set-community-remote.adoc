= Configuring the community remote repository and syncing {Galaxy} collections

You can edit the *community* remote repository to synchronize chosen collections from {Galaxy} to your {PrivateHubName}.
By default, your {PrivateHubName} community repository directs to `galaxy.ansible.com/api/`.

.Prerequisites

* You have *Modify Ansible repo content* permissions.
See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/{PlatformVers}/html/managing_user_access_in_private_automation_hub/index[Managing user access in Automation Hub] for more information on permissions.
* You have a `requirements.yml` file that identifies those collections to synchronize from {Galaxy} as in the following example:

.Requirements.yml example
-----
collections:
  # Install a collection from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: geerlingguy.php_roles
    version: 0.9.3
    source: https://galaxy.ansible.com
-----

.Procedure
. Log in to your {HubNameMain}.
. Navigate to menu:Repo Management[].
. Click the *Remotes* tab.
. In the *Community* remote, click the btn:[More Actions] icon image:images/ellipsis.png[More,5,12] and click btn:[Edit].
. In the modal, click btn:[Browse] and locate the `requirements.yml` file on your local machine.
. Click btn:[Save].
+
The modal closes and returns you to the *Repo Management* page.
You can now synchronize collections identified in your `requirements.yml` file from {Galaxy} to your {PrivateHubName}.

. Click btn:[Sync] to sync collections from {Galaxy} and {HubNameMain}.

The *Sync status* notification updates to notify you of completion or failure of {Galaxy} collections synchronization to your {HubNameMain}.

.Verification

You can confirm successful synchronization by selecting *Community* from the collections content drop-down list.
