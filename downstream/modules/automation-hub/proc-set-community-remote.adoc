= Configuring the community remote repository and syncing Ansible Galaxy collections.

You can edit the *community* remote repository to sync chosen collections from Ansible Galaxy to your local Automation Hub. By default, your local Automation Hub `community` repository directs to `https://galaxy.ansible.com/api/v2/collections`.

.Prerequisites

* You have *Modify Ansible repo content* permissions. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/1.0/html/managing_user_access_in_automation_hub/index[Managing user access in Automation Hub] for more information on permissions.
* You have a `requirements.yml` file that identifies those collections to sync from Ansible Galaxy. See example below.

.Requirements.yml example
-----
collections:
  # Install a collection from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: geerlingguy.php_roles
    version: 0.9.3
    source: https://galaxy.ansible.com
-----

.Procedure
. Log in to your local Automation Hub.
. Navigate to *Repo Management*.
. Click the *Remotes* tab.
. In the *community* remote, click image:more_actions.png[More actions] and click *Edit*.
. In the modal, click *Browse* and locate the `requirements.yml` file on your local machine.
. Click *Save*.

The modal will close and return you to the *Repo Management* page. You can now sync collections identified in your `requirements.yml` file from Ansible Galaxy to your local Automation Hub.

. Click *Sync* to sync collections from Ansible Galaxy and Automation Hub.

The *Sync status* notification will update to notify you of completion or failure of Ansible Galaxy collections sync to your Automation Hub.

You can confirm successful sync by selecting *Community* from the collections content drop-down list.
