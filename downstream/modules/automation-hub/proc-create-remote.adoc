= Create a remote

Use this procedure to create a remote configuration to an external collection.

.Procedure
. Log in to {PlatformName}.
. Navigate to menu:Automation Hub[Remotes].
. Click btn:[Add Remote].
. Enter a *Name* for the remote configuration.
. Enter the *URL* for the remote server, including the path for the specific repository.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can obtain this information by navigating to menu:Automation Hub[Repositories], selecting your repository, and clicking btn:[Copy CLI configuration].
====
+
. Configure the credentials to the remote server by entering a *Token* or *Username* and *Password* required to access the external collection.
+
[NOTE]
====
A Token can be generated by navigating to menu:Automation Hub[API token], clicking btn:[Load token] and copying the token that is loaded.
====
+
. To access collections from console.redhat.com, enter the *SSO URL* to sign in to the  identity provider (IdP).
. Select or create a *YAML requirements* file to identify the collections and version ranges to synchronize with your custom repository. For example, to only download the kubernetes and AWS collection versions 5.0.0 or later the requirements file would look like this:
+
-----
Collections:
 	  - name: community.kubernetes
	  - name: community.aws
 		version:”>=5.0.0”
-----
+
[NOTE]
====
All collection dependencies are automatically downloaded during the Sync process.
====
+
. To configure your remote further, use the options available under *Advanced configuration*:
.. If there is a corporate proxy in place for your organization, enter a *Proxy URL*, *Proxy Username* and *Proxy Password*.
.. Enable or disable transport layer security using *TLS validation* checkbox.
.. If digital certificates are required for authentication, enter a *Client key* and *Client certificate*.
.. If you are using a self-signed SSL certificate for your server, enter the PEM encoded client certificate used for authentication in the *CA certificate* field.
.. To accelerate the speed at which collections in this remote can be downloaded, specify the number of collections that can be downloaded in tandem in the *Download concurrency* field.
.. To limit the number of queries per second on this remote, specify a *Rate Limit*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Some servers can have a specific rate limit set and if exceeded, synchronization will fail.
