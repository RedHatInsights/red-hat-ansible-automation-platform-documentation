= Role Based Access Conrol

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts user access to custom repositories based on their defined role. By default, users can view all public repositories in their {HubName}, but they can not modify them unless they have explicit permission to do so. This is the same for other operations on the repository. For example, removing a user's rights revokes their ability to download content from a custom repository.
