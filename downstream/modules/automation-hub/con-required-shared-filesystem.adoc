= Required shared filesystem

A high availability {HubName} requires you to have a shared file system, such as NFS, already installed in your environment. 
Before you run the {PlatformName} installer, verify that you installed the `/var/lib/pulp` directory across your cluster as part of the shared file system installation. 
The {PlatformName} installer returns an error if `/var/lib/pulp` is not detected in one of your nodes, causing your high availability {HubName} setup to fail.
