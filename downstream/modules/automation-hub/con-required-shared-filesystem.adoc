= Required shared filesystem

A high availability {HubName} requires you to have a shared file system already set up in your environment. Before you run the {PlatformName} installer, verify that the `/var/lib/pulp` directory exists across your cluster as a result of your shared file system installation. The {PlatformName} installer will return an error if `/var/lib/pulp` is not detected in one of your nodes, causing your HA {HubName} setup to fail.
