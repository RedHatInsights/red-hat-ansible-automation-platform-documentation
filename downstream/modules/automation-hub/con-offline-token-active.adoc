= Keeping your offline token active

Keeping an offline token active is useful when an application needs to perform action on behalf of the user, even when the user is offline. For example, a routine data backup.

Offline tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity. You can keep your offline token from expiring by periodically refreshing your offline token.

[NOTE]
Once your offline token expires, you must request a new one.

Run the following command periodically to prevent your token from expiring:
----
curl https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token -d grant_type=refresh_token -d client_id="cloud-services" -d refresh_token="{{ user_token }}" --fail --silent --show-error --output /dev/null
----
