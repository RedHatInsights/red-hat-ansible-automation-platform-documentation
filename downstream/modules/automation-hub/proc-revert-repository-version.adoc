= Revert to a different repository version

When content is added or removed from a repository, a new version of it is created. If there are issues with a change to your custom repository, you can revert to a previous version. Reverting is a safe operation and does not delete content from the system, but rather, changes the content associated with the repository. The number of versions saved is defined in the *Retained number of versions* setting when a xref:proc-create-repository[repository is created].
