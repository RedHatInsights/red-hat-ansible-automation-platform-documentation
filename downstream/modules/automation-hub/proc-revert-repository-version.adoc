[id="proc-revert-repository-version"]

= Revert to a different {HubName} repository version

When automation content collections are added or removed from a repository, a new version is created. If there are issues with a change to your repository, you can revert to a previous version. Reverting is a safe operation and does not delete collections from the system, but rather, changes the content associated with the repository. The number of versions saved is defined in the *Retained number of versions* setting when a xref:proc-create-repository[repository is created].

.Procedure

. Locate the version you want to rollback to and click the btn:[More Actions] icon *{MoreActionsIcon}*, then select *Revert to this version*.
. Click btn:[Revert].
