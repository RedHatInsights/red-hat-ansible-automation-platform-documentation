include::attributes/attributes.adoc[]

Included with a subscription to {PlatformName}, {CertifiedColl} feature {CertifiedName} and {Valid}, as well as {Galaxy} content from the community. 
Using {HubNameMain}, your organization can access and curate a unique set of collections from all forms of Ansible content. 

At present, you can only obtain {Valid} as part of the Platform Installer.
When you download the bundled installer by default Validated Content will be pre-populated into the {PrivateHubName}, if the {PrivateHubName} is enabled as part of the inventory.

You can also synchronize {HubNameMain} to create a custom list of collections from either {CertifiedCon}, {valid}, or {Galaxy} community content. 

Initially, Ansible validated collections will only be available in your {PrivateHubName}
These collections can be preloaded into {PrivateHubName} using the installer and can be updated manually by downloading their packages.
