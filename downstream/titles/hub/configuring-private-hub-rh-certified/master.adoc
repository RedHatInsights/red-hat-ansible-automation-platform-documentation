= Managing Red Hat Certified, validated and Ansible Galaxy content in automation hub
:numbered:
:experimental:

include::attributes/attributes.adoc[]

{CertifiedColl} is included in your subscription to {PlatformName}. Red Hat Ansible content inclues two types of content: {CertifiedName} and {Valid}. 
Using {HubNameMain}, you can access and curate a unique set of collections from all forms of Ansible content. 

Ansible validated collections are available in your {PrivateHubName} through the Platform Installer.
When you download {PlatformName} with the bundled installer, validated content is pre-populated into the {PrivateHubName} by default, but only if you enable the {PrivateHubName} as part of the inventory.

If you are not using the bundle installer, a Red Hat supplied Ansible playbook can be used to install validated content. 
For further information, see xref:assembly-validated-content[{Valid}]

You can update these collections manually by downloading their packages.
