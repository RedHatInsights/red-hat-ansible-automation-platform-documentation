= Configuring Red Hat Automation Hub as the primary source of Ansible content

The Ansible Galaxy client, `ansible-galaxy`, manages roles and collections from the command line.

To ensure that `ansible-galaxy` uses certified, supported Ansible collections whenever possible, you should update the `ansible.cfg` configuration file to use Red Hat Automation Hub as the primary source of Ansible collections.

Optionally, you can configure Ansible Galaxy as a secondary source of content.

include::aap-common/making-open-source-more-inclusive.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::modules/automation-hub/proc-configure-automation-hub-server-cli.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

You have now configured automation hub as your primary server using CLI, and can proceed to download and install supported collections.
