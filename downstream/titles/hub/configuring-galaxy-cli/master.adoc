= Configuring Red Hat Automation Hub as the primary source of Ansible content

The Ansible Galaxy client, `ansible-galaxy`, manages roles and collections from the command line.

To ensure that `ansible-galaxy` uses certified, supported Ansible collections whenever possible, you should update the `ansible.cfg` configuration file to use Red Hat Automation Hub as the primary source of Ansible collections.

Optionally, you can configure Ansible Galaxy as a secondary source of content.

include::modules/automation-hub/proc-configure-automation-hub-server.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

You have now configured Ansible Automation Hub as your default server and can proceed to download and install supported collections.

For more information on server list configuration options and using Ansible Galaxy as an Ansible content source, see the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#configuring-the-ansible-galaxy-client[Ansible Galaxy User Guide].
