= Deploying a high availability automation hub

This guide provides an overview of the requirements and procedures for a high availability deployment of your {HubName}.

A high availability (HA) configuration provides a reliable and scalable solution that minimizes downtime for your Ansible automation environment. HA prepares your system for damage mitigation, where a failure in a primary cluster prompts a standby cluster to take over, resulting in no downtime for the customer. To set up a HA deployment of {HubName}, configure the {PlatformName}(AAP) installer based on the requirements detailed in this guide.

Please note that this guide covers deployment of a HA {HubName} application stack only. Other HA components, such as database and file system HA, or setting up DNS load balancing, are out of scope for this guide.
