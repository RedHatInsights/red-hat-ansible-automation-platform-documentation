Red Hat Automation Hub distributes certified, supported collections from partners to customers. Each collection includes content such as modules, roles, plugins and documentation. The first time you upload a collection to Automation Hub, our Partner Engineering team will start reviewing it for certification.

You can upload collections using the Automation Hub user interface or the `ansible-galaxy` client.

Once uploaded, your collections will enter the partner certification process. Our Partner Engineering team will contact you with the certification status of your collection.
