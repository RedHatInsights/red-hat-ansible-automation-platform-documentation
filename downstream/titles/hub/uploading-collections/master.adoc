= Uploading content to Red Hat Automation Hub

{Hubnamestart} distributes certified, supported collections from partners to customers. Each collection includes content such as modules, roles, plugins and documentation. The first time you upload a collection to {HubName}, our Partner Engineering team will start reviewing it for certification.

You can manage your collections by uploading or deleting collections using the {HubName} user interface or the `ansible-galaxy` client.
