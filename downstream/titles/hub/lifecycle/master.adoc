= Private Automation Hub life cycle

== Overview

As part of an Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription, customers have access to a supported version of Automation Hub. Red Hat provides a published product life cycle for Automation Hub so that customers and partners can properly plan, deploy, support, and maintain their private Automation Hub(s) that they use with the Ansible Automation Platform.
This life cycle encompasses stated time periods for each version of Automation Hub, starting with 4.2. The life cycle for each version of Automation Hub is split into production phases, each identifying the various levels of maintenance over a period of time from the initial release date. While multiple versions of Automation Hub will be supported at any one time, note that this life cycle applies to each specific version of Automation Hub (4.2, 4.3 and so on).

Customers are expected to upgrade their Automation Hub environments to the most current supported version of the product in a timely fashion. Bug fixes and feature-work will target only the latest versions of the product, though some allowance may be given for high security risk items.
