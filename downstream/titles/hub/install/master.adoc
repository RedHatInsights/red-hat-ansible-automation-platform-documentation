====

== Installing online or offline

Choose the Ansible Automation Platform installer you need to install Private Automation Hub based on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment internet connectivity. Review the scenarios below and determine which Ansible Automation Platform installer meets your needs.

[NOTE]
====
A valid Red Hat customer account is required to access Ansible Automation Platform installer downloads on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
====

.Installing with internet access

Install Private Automation Hub using the Ansible Automation Platform installer if your Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment is connected to the internet. Installing with internet access will retrieve the latest required repositories, packages, and dependencies.

. Navigate to https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480
. Click btn:[Download Now] for the *Ansible Automation Platform <latest-version> Setup*.
. Extract the files:
+
-----
$ tar xvzf ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest-version>.tar.gz
-----


.Installing without internet access

Install Private Automation Hub using the Ansible Automation Platform *Bundle* installer if you are unable to access the internet, or would prefer not to install separate components and dependencies from online repositories. Access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux repositories is still needed. All other dependencies are included in the tar archive.

. Navigate to https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/480
. Click btn:[Download Now] for the *Ansible Automation Platform <latest-version> Setup Bundle*.
. Extract the files:
+
-----
$ tar xvzf ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-<latest-version>.tar.gz
-----

== Editing the inventory file

Edit the `inventory` file to specify an installation of Automation Hub, and update required parameters.

. Navigate to the installer.
.. [bundled installer]
+
-----
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-<latest-version>
-----
+
.. [online installer]
+
-----
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest-version>
-----
+
. Open the `inventory` file with a text editor.
. Edit `inventory` file parameters to specify an installation of Automaton Hub host only. Follow the example below.
.. Leave `[automationcontroller]` inventory information *empty*.
.. Add `[automationhub]` group host information.
+
[NOTE]
====
Provide a reachable IP address for the `[automationhub]` host to ensure users can sync content from Private Automation Hub from a different node.
====
+
.. Update the values for `automationhub_admin_password` and `automation_pg_password` and any additional parameters based on your installation specifications:
+
.Example
-----
[automationcontroller]


[automationhub]
<reachable-ip> ansible_connection=local

[all:vars]
automationhub_admin_password= <PASSWORD>

automationhub_pg_host=''
automationhub_pg_port=''

automationhub_pg_database='automationhub'
automationhub_pg_username='automationhub'
automationhub_pg_password=<PASSWORD>
automationhub_pg_sslmode='prefer'

# The default install will deploy a TLS enabled Automation Hub.
# If for some reason this is not the behavior wanted one can
# disable TLS enabled deployment.
#
# automationhub_disable_https = False
# The default install will generate self-signed certificates for the Automation
# Hub service. If you are providing valid certificate via automationhub_ssl_cert
# and automationhub_ssl_key, one should toggle that value to True.
#
# automationhub_ssl_validate_certs = False
# SSL-related variables
# If set, this will install a custom CA certificate to the system trust store.
# custom_ca_cert=/path/to/ca.crt
# Certificate and key to install in Automation Hub node
# automationhub_ssl_cert=/path/to/automationhub.cert
# automationhub_ssl_key=/path/to/automationhub.key
