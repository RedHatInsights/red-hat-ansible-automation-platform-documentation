= Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 1.2.4

.Bug fixes

* Added the ability for Ansible Automation Platform 1.2.x to transition from venvs to execution environments smoothly to platform 2.x This includes three new `awx-manage` commands, check associations, and export venvs for building an execution environment.

* Added Ansible 2.9.25 to the platform installer package

* Fixed Towerâ€™s NGINX Instance vulnerability (CVE-2021-23017). For any deployments on RHEL 8, the package comes from RHEL, and just applying the RHEL update resolves this.

* Updated the backup and restore to now work without the `automationhub` group
