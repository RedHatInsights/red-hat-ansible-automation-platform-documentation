// Book Title
= Installing and Configuring Central Authentication for the Ansible Automation Platform

{AAPCentralAuth} is a third-party identity provider (idP) solution, allowing for a simplified single sign-on solution that can be used across the {PlatformNameShort}. Platform administrators can utilize {CentralAuth} to test connectivity and authentication, as well as onboard new users and manage user permissions by configuring and assigning them to groups. Along with OpenID Connect-based and LDAP support, {CentralAuth} also provides a supported REST API which can be used to bootstrap customer usage.
