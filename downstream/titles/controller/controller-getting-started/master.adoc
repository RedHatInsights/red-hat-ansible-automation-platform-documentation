// Book Title
= Getting started with automation controller

To begin, install {PlatformNameShort} and choose a target system where you can deploy an initial playbook (provided by {ControllerName}). 
This first playbook executes simple Ansible tasks, while teaching you how to use the controller and properly set it up.
You can use any sort of system manageable by Ansible, as described in the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/basic_concepts.html#managed-nodes[Managed nodes] section of the Ansible documentation.
For further instructions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/index[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide].

[NOTE]
